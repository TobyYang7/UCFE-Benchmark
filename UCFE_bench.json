The list is compiled by \"Fortune\" (Chinese edition) in collaboration with the Wealth Management Department of China International Capital Corporation (CICC). This year, the total revenue of the 500 listed companies on the list reached 45.5 trillion yuan, an increase of 14.8% over last year, setting a new record; net profit reached 3.625 trillion yuan, an increase of 4.21% over last year. Compared to last year's growth rate of 24.24%, it has significantly slowed down due to the impact of the macroeconomic environment. The revenue threshold for companies on the list this year is 16.238 billion yuan, an increase of 17% compared to last year. Last year, China's GDP exceeded 90 trillion yuan for the first time, and the total revenue of these 500 listed companies once again exceeded half of China's GDP for the year. The leading companies on the list remain: Sinopec, PetroChina, and China State Construction. Ping An Insurance continues to be the top non-state-owned enterprise. This year, there are a total of 42 new and re-listed companies, among which Xiaomi Group ranks 53rd with a total revenue of 174.9 billion yuan. Meituan Dianping ranks 140th with a revenue of 65.2 billion yuan. In the food industry, Haidilao, which entered the 500 list for the first time this year (ranked 482nd), attracted much attention with a total revenue of 17 billion yuan in 2018. Additionally, TAL Education Group (ranked 483rd) became the first education industry enterprise to make it to the China 500 list. In terms of industries, the internet services sector led by Alibaba and Tencent, although accounting for only 2% of the total revenue of all 500 companies, has a market value close to 11 trillion yuan, accounting for 23.7% of the total market value of the China 500. According to CICC analysis: affected by the economic cycle, the overall performance of the more traditional real estate and financial industries was weak over the past year. The new economy sector, composed of electronics, internet services, and computer-related industries, continued its previous high growth trend, with the number of listed companies increasing to 37, and sector revenue growing by 29% year-on-year. For more analysis, please see the summary from the CICC research team at the end of the list. In terms of profitability, similar to last year, the top 10 most profitable listed companies, besides several major commercial banks and insurance companies, remain China Mobile Limited, Tencent Holdings Limited, and Alibaba Group Holding Limited. These ten companies achieved a total profit of 1.46 trillion yuan last year, accounting for 40.3% of the total profit of all listed companies. In 2019, a total of 30 companies in the China 500 were unprofitable, with total losses reaching 177.1 billion yuan. Meituan Dianping, which made the list for the first time this year, topped the loss list with a loss of nearly 115.5 billion yuan. Last year's new entrant iQIYI had a loss of 9.4 billion yuan. Among all listed companies, Guangdong Shaogang Songshan Co., Ltd. retained the top spot on the ROE list. Seven of the top ten companies last year were in the steel industry, and five of them remain in the top ten of the ROE list this year. ——Editorial Department 1 China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation Revenue (million yuan): 2,891,179 {IMG:3} March 13, 2019, Guangzhou, Guangdong.

(hereinafter referred to as Toread), the first stock in outdoor products, announced its 2018 semi-annual report. Data shows that during the reporting period, the listed company's revenue and net profit both declined, and operating cash flow was also insufficient, making the performance quite dismal. The reason may be related to the failure of Toread's diversified layout strategy. \n    Poor sales and dismal performance may be due to the company's distraction \n    Recently, Toread announced its 2018 semi-annual report. Performance data shows that in the first half of this year, the company's operating income was 877 million yuan, a decrease of 31.38% compared to the same period last year; the net profit attributable to shareholders of the listed company was 24.12 million yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 69.47%; after deducting non-recurring gains and losses, the net profit attributable to shareholders of the listed company was 6.35 million yuan, a year-on-year decline of 89.02%, only a quarter of the net profit attributable to the parent company. \n    Toread's revenue and net profit both declined, and the performance was not very satisfactory. In this regard, the company explained that it was mainly due to the sharp decrease in international air tickets for travel services in China and the substantial increase in inventory write-downs during the reporting period compared to the same period last year. \n    In fact, this is not the first time Toread's performance has suffered. \n    Since 2015, Toread's net profit has shown a downward trend. The net profits attributable to the parent company in 2015, 2016, and 2017 were 263 million yuan, 166 million yuan, and -84.85 million yuan, respectively, a year-on-year decrease of 10.50%, 37.13%, and 151.24%. In the first half of this year, the company's product gross profit margin slightly increased, preventing a further decline in net profit, but it still could not reverse the performance downturn in recent years.\nEntity: Huabei",

Residents of mainland China aged between 18 and 55 can try to apply for JD Baitiao through the JD Finance App. Once the application is approved, you can enjoy the JD Baitiao service. The same ID card and phone number can only activate one Baitiao account.\nThe JD Baitiao credit limit is comprehensively determined based on the applicant's consumption level and frequency in JD Mall, membership level, and other information.\nThe maximum JD Baitiao credit limit is 15,000 yuan, and it varies for each user. The general JD Baitiao credit limit ranges from 3,000 yuan to 6,000 yuan, while the JD Campus Baitiao credit limit generally ranges from 3,000 yuan to 8,000 yuan. You can see the specific JD Baitiao credit limit after you activate JD Baitiao.\nCurrently, JD Baitiao does not support proactive applications to increase the credit limit. JD will adjust the credit limit based on the usage and consumption situation of JD Baitiao members.

It is believed that with the continuous deepening of elderly-friendly modifications, there will be more and more considerate and heartwarming measures.",

There are 3 directions with significant investment value: (1) Innovative pharmaceutical and medical device industry chain. With the promotion and coverage of policies such as DRGs, DIP, and centralized procurement, as well as the crackdown on high sales expense varieties due to anti-corruption, pharmaceutical companies are being forced to accelerate innovative research and development, launching innovative products that truly meet clinical needs. This also helps leading enterprises enhance their international competitiveness. (2) Retail pharmacies. Medical anti-corruption in countries such as Germany, the United States, and Japan has accelerated the outflow of prescriptions, gradually achieving the separation of medicine and pharmacy. The concentration of leading chain pharmacies has rapidly increased, and the trend of prescription outflow in China is expected to further strengthen after medical anti-corruption. (3) Medical informatization. After anti-corruption, regulatory authorities have higher requirements for the transparency of medical data. The penetration rates of DRGs payment systems, electronic medical records, and in-hospital logistics systems (SPD) are expected to continue to increase. Potential risks include the execution of medical anti-corruption not meeting expectations and the performance growth of related companies not meeting expectations.",

      "information": "This week, the National Bureau of Statistics released the 2023 investment and development investment situation of the real estate industry. In 2023, the sales area and sales volume of commercial housing were 1.12 billion square meters and 11.7 trillion yuan respectively, down 8.5% and 6.5% year-on-year. The industry scale continued to decline in 2023, with sales volume basically returning to the level of 2016, and sales area even returning to the level of 2012. Affected by factors such as the current weak expectations of residents' income and employment, some housing demand being overdrawn in the early stage, residents' concerns about the delivery of new houses, and the decline in housing prices exacerbating the wait-and-see sentiment, the real estate market is still hovering at the bottom, continuing a pulse-like recovery trend. At the same time, affected by many factors such as the continuous weakening of the volume and price of the real estate market, the continuous contraction of real estate enterprise financing, and the frequent occurrence of real estate enterprise thunderstorm risks, the supply side of the industry has shrunk significantly, and real estate enterprises' land acquisition and new construction have continued to be under pressure. In 2023, real estate development investment was 11.1 trillion yuan, down 9.6% year-on-year; the new construction area was 950 million square meters, down 20.4% year-on-year. The scale of development investment in 2023 returned to the level of 2018; the volume of new construction has reached the lowest level since 2008, down nearly 60% from the peak in 2019. Looking ahead to 2024, the recovery of the real estate market still depends on whether the expectations of home buyers can be restored, and there is still room for policy efforts on both the supply and demand sides. The two major projects of credit repair and the construction of affordable housing and urban village renovation may jointly promote the bottoming out and recovery of the real estate market. Real estate sales and investment in 2024 are expected to improve marginally, but the overall scale is expected to continue to operate at a low level. We believe that in the short term, attention should be paid to the actual effects and sustainability of the recent support policies, and in the medium and long term, attention should be paid to the industry opportunities brought by the promotion of urban village renovation and affordable housing construction. Under the current background, real estate enterprises with liquidity safety, heavy positions in high-energy cities, and outstanding product strength may have more α attributes. High-quality private enterprises with stable operations and mixed-ownership real estate enterprises may benefit from more targeted financing support policies in the future. If they can survive this cycle, they may have greater valuation repair flexibility. At this stage, we recommend focusing on four main lines: 1) Central and state-owned enterprises with no liquidity risk and good land acquisition and sales fundamentals: Poly Developments, China Merchants Shekou, China Resources Land, C&D International Group, Yuexiu Property, Huafa Industrial, Greentown China. 2) Private enterprises with relatively high safety coefficients: Binjiang Group, Midea Real Estate. 3) Companies with bottom rebound and greater flexibility: Gemdale Corporation, Longfor Group. 4) Companies with urban village renovation and affordable housing construction, or REITs related theme opportunities: China Communications Real Estate, Urban Construction Development, China Enterprise, Nanshan Holdings. Risk warning: Real estate regulation upgrade; sales decline beyond expectations; financing tightening.",

      "information": "AI explosive development + industry cycle upward double-click, computing power transmission system \"Three Kingdoms dispute.\" The data communication market in Q1 2024 is expected to enter a new upward cycle, while the demand for computing power from AI remains hot. We anticipate that 2024 will still be a big year for computing power construction. Most companies use InfiniBand network technology when building GPU computing power networks. However, InfiniBand is only supported by Nvidia as a single supplier, making it expensive. Some major internet companies are beginning to explore building GPU computing power networks based on Ethernet, gradually reducing their reliance on InfiniBand networks. Meanwhile, Google has developed data transmission technology that uses light instead of electronics. The demand for intelligent computing network upgrades brings market opportunities to the related industrial chain. Intelligent driving will become one of the killer applications in the AI era, and lidar may become a pearl. We believe that 2024 will be the inaugural year of lidar \"from 1 to 100.\" By 2025, the penetration rate of lidar is expected to double compared to 2023, and the average number of lidar units per vehicle will also increase significantly, creating a market opportunity worth hundreds of billions. At the same time, China leads the global lidar industry, particularly in the fields of optical transceiver components, communication processing systems, and scanning systems, with mature and leading industry players participating. The era of space and terrestrial internet connectivity is coming, and 2024 is expected to enter an industrial acceleration period. Huawei's Mate60 series leads the satellite communication revolution, marking a significant leap from commercial to civilian use of satellite communication in China. Meanwhile, the commercial aerospace sector's pursuit of SpaceX, the success of Starlink, and the launch of plans such as Shanghai G60 have pushed low-orbit satellite communication to new heights. We believe that 2024 will also be the inaugural year for satellite communication to move from experimentation to commercialization, benefiting production and manufacturing, launch, terminal enterprises, and operators.",

      "information": "China's insurance market has the highest proportion of life insurance, reflecting the importance residents place on family and personal economic and health protection. Currently, China's insurance market shows diversity in the proportion of premiums for different types of insurance. Among them, life insurance premiums account for the largest proportion of premium income structure, reaching 52%. This reflects the increasing trend in demand for pension insurance as China's population structure enters the aging stage. As the aging of the population further intensifies, people's demand for post-retirement life protection is increasing, thus the pension insurance market has broad development prospects. At the same time, property insurance premiums also show a steady growth trend, accounting for 27%. This is mainly due to the rapid development of China's economy, and the increasing demand for property loss protection from enterprises and individuals. In addition, with the improvement of people's living standards and the acceleration of urbanization, insurance types related to automobiles, housing insurance, etc., have also developed rapidly, further promoting the development of the property insurance market. Moreover, health insurance premiums are growing rapidly, reflecting the importance Chinese residents place on personal health protection. This is related to the improvement of people's health awareness and the rise in medical expenses. As medical expenses continue to rise and people's attention to health increases, more and more consumers are choosing to purchase health insurance products to obtain better medical protection. Overall, personal insurance (including life insurance and health insurance) dominates the premium income structure. This is because personal insurance products provide family economic protection and personal health protection, with a high degree of protection. Therefore, whether in the life insurance market or the health insurance market, personal insurance products occupy a large market share. At the same time, with the improvement of Chinese residents' understanding and demand for insurance, the development prospects of the personal insurance market remain broad.",

      "information": "Always prioritize ensuring national food security; global food price fluctuations drive up planting willingness and fertilizer demand. Food security is a \"major national issue\" and is an important foundation for achieving economic development, social stability, and national security. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China's grain production capacity has been continuously enhanced. However, the basic national condition of a large population and limited arable land has not changed, and the foundation of food security is still not solid enough. The tight balance between grain supply and demand in China will not change for a long time, and ensuring the area of arable land will support domestic fertilizer demand. At the same time, in recent years, the rise in global food prices has increased the awareness of food security in various countries, which is expected to drive the willingness to plant and the demand for fertilizers globally. China's dependence on potash imports is high, and Chinese policies encourage enterprises to go abroad to seek potash. Due to the relative scarcity of potash resources in China and the difficulty in increasing production, China has long relied on potash imports. China has formulated a \"three-thirds\" strategy for the potash industry, namely one-third domestic production, one-third foreign imports, and one-third establishing overseas production bases to support the domestic market. Many enterprises, such as Zhonglao Mining, China Hydropower Mining, China Agricultural Minerals, Laos Kaiyuan Mining, Beijing Puyue, Haiwang Mining, and Sichuan Longmang, have \"gone abroad to seek potash\" and obtained exploration and mining rights overseas. Investment advice: In the short term, the spring fertilizer stocking season is approaching in March-April, and the potash affordability index has returned to normal levels, so the prosperity of the potash industry is expected to improve. In the long term, there is a mismatch between global potash resource supply and demand, and China's dependence on potash imports is high. Potash resource exploitation in Laos has significant advantages, and the overseas capacity deployment of domestic enterprises is expected to benefit. It is recommended to pay attention to enterprises involved in overseas potash resource exploitation and potash fertilizer production, as well as leading domestic potash fertilizer enterprises, such as Asia Potash International, Salt Lake Potash, and Zangge Mining. Risk warnings: Risks of policy changes; risks of raw material price increases; risks of sea freight price increases; risks of food price fluctuations.",

      "information": "Mass Products: (1) Snacks: Leading companies show outstanding performance, and the bulk snack dividend continues. Last week, Ganyuan Foods released its 2023 performance forecast, expecting a net profit attributable to shareholders of listed companies of 295 million to 335 million yuan in 2023, a year-on-year increase of 86.35% to 111.62%. The company adheres to an all-channel development strategy, continuously optimizes product structure and new product development, and with the prices of raw materials such as palm oil and macadamia nuts falling, net profit grows steadily. As the snack market continues to expand and industry concentration increases, leading companies with strong product growth logic, significant brand and scale effects, and rapid channel expansion will benefit first. It is recommended to pay attention to Yanjin Shop, Ganyuan Foods, and Jinzi Foods. (2) Frozen Foods: The pre-prepared food industry has rigid demand in the catering sector, with fast industry growth and relatively dispersed competition. Priority should be given to leading companies with strong single-product creation capabilities. Pre-prepared foods, with their standardized taste and easy preparation, effectively address the high labor costs and slow serving speeds in the catering industry. Therefore, the increase in catering chain rates, group meal growth, and the development of takeout jointly drive the growth of the pre-prepared food industry, and the industry's penetration rate is expected to increase rapidly. It is recommended to pay attention to Anjoy Foods, which has obvious advantages in production capacity and channels, and Qianwei Central Kitchen, which continues to enrich its product categories. (3) Dairy Products: Benefiting from the decline in raw milk prices, dairy companies have high performance elasticity. With consumers' demand for health and diversification, the acceptance of low-temperature dairy products is increasing, and the trend of product premiumization is accelerating. It is recommended to pay attention to New Dairy, which continuously upgrades its product structure and increases the penetration rate of DTC channels.",

      "information": "The majority of demand in the computer industry comes from the G-end represented by the party, government, and military, and the large B-end represented by key central state-owned enterprises in critical industries. In the context of the low base in 2022 and the overall environment in 2023, although industry demand shows an improving trend, the overall intensity is not high. From the perspective of industry structure, the industrial software and informatization fields represented by Supcon Technology, ZWSOFT, and Nancal Technology, the financial and tax informatization track represented by Sino-Science South and Boss Software, the overseas direction represented by Wondershare Technology, EZVIZ Network, and Streamax Technology, and the fintech sector represented by Wealth Trend are expected to be in a strong operating trend. However, directions such as cybersecurity, information innovation, government IT, and medical IT may experience delays in demand realization or revenue recognition due to downstream payment capabilities and anti-corruption efforts, leading to a weaker operating trend. From the perspective of profit elasticity, considering that many computer companies have reduced personnel investment since the second half of 2022; after entering the second half of 2023, the tail-end factors have basically ended; some companies' gross profit margins have stabilized or rebounded, and revenue growth has improved, showing a trend of net profit margin recovery, i.e., profit elasticity is higher than revenue elasticity, as evidenced by the performance forecasts of companies such as Wealth Trend, Streamax Technology, EZVIZ Network, and SuperMap Software. From the perspective of future industry trends, we believe that the directions more likely to produce results are still in areas where demand comes from the rigid budget support of the central government and economically developed regions, investment by key central state-owned enterprises, and fields where overseas investments have begun to show results. We expect that the industry themes in 2024 may further unfold along the AI industry chain, Huawei industry chain, data elements, MR, and other directions. Investment advice: Considering the industry structure, profit elasticity, and future prosperity, it is recommended to pay attention to computer industry companies such as Supcon Technology, Wondershare Technology, Wealth Trend, EZVIZ Network, and Hikvision. Risk warning: Demand, policy, technology, etc., may not meet expectations; intensified competition may affect profit margins, etc.",

      "information": "Pig: The rise in pig prices is weak, and capacity reduction continues. According to data from Soozhu.com, the national average price of live pigs this week is 13.74 yuan/kg, which is basically the same as last week. In the first half of the week, prices in some northern regions led the rise, mainly due to supply interruptions and holiday stocking; in the second half of the week, live pigs transported from the south entered the market, dragging down prices in northern regions over the weekend. Before the holiday, pig prices continued to be weak during the peak season. As the Spring Festival approaches, consumer demand may slowly pick up, and slaughter stocking demand will also be concentrated, but the impact on pig prices will be limited. From April to September 2023, the number of new piglets nationwide increased by 5.9% year-on-year, which means that the supply of live pigs before the Spring Festival will increase year-on-year, limiting the rise in pig prices. From an investment perspective, after a whole year of capacity reduction in 2023, the industry is likely to improve month-on-month in 2024. At the same time, the current industry valuation is at a historical low, making it a good time for left-side layout. We recommend prioritizing targets with significant cost advantages while also considering growth potential. 1) Leading companies have relatively obvious cost advantages and stronger certainty in slaughtering. Recommended attention: Muyuan Foods, Wens Foodstuff. 2) Small and medium-sized enterprises have faster slaughter growth rates and greater room for cost reduction. Recommended attention: Juxing Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, Huazhong Stock, Tiankang Biology, and Tangrenshen.",

Q1 is traditionally a low season for the passenger car market, with the switch in new energy vehicle purchase tax incentives and year-end car company sales rush slightly overdrawing early-year demand.

The company's Q4 revenue maintained steady growth against the backdrop of a low base last year, with new brands continuing their high growth momentum. Xtep International's main brand Q4 single-quarter retail revenue grew by more than 30% year-on-year, reflecting the company's good revenue growth under its professional advantage in the running shoe field. The company's Q4 average retail discount level was about 30% off, basically at a healthy level. As of the end of 2023, the inventory-to-sales ratio was 4-4.5 months, continuing the improvement trend from the third quarter. 361 Degrees' main brand retail sales in Q4 recorded a positive growth of more than 20% year-on-year. The company has deeply promoted the construction and integration of online and offline channels, driving steady growth in offline revenue through the increase in the number of stores and store efficiency.

The Q4 retail sales of the company's children's clothing brand recorded a positive growth of about 40% year-on-year. Overall, sports apparel companies' Q4 retail revenue maintained steady growth against the backdrop of fluctuating domestic demand. As major companies advance their inventory reduction strategies, inventory pressure is easing. We are optimistic about major sports apparel companies gearing up for 2024, focusing on products and marketing, and are expected to maintain rapid growth catalyzed by the Olympic year. We still maintain the judgment of steady growth in apparel consumption in 2024. 1. Apparel with strong rigid demand and functional scene attributes is expected to cross cycles against the backdrop of consumption uncertainty. We recommend Biem.L.Fdlkk and K-Boxing, which have better consumer mindshare construction. HLA, a cost-effective mass apparel company, and Jinhong Group, a brand focusing on the academy style track. 2. We recommend Bosideng, which has greater elasticity in profit recovery and still has cost-effective valuation targets. 3. The inventory reduction at the sports apparel terminal is nearing its end, and the 2024 Olympics is expected to form a catalyst. We recommend: Anta Sports, Xtep International, Li Ning. 4. Exports are expected to continue to recover in 2024. We recommend Huali Group, Shenzhou International, and New Australia Holdings.",

      "information": "This week, the National Bureau of Statistics released retail data. The total retail sales of consumer goods for the whole year of 2023 reached 47.15 trillion yuan, a record high, with a year-on-year growth of 7.2%. In December 2023 alone, the total retail sales of consumer goods in China amounted to 4.36 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 7.4%, which is lower than the consensus expectation of Wind. In terms of cosmetics, the year-on-year growth of cosmetics in December showed some recovery, with the retail sales of cosmetics units above the designated size increasing by 9.7% year-on-year in December, compared to 13.2% year-on-year in November. The cumulative year-on-year growth of cosmetics retail sales from January to December was 5.1%, showing a steady upward trend overall.② The State Council's No. 1 document supports the anti-aging industry. The General Office of the State Council issued the \"Opinions on Developing the Silver Economy to Enhance the Well-being of the Elderly\" (Guobanfa [2024] No. 1), proposing 26 measures in four aspects. The 17th measure is to \"develop the anti-aging industry. Deepen research on skin aging mechanisms, human aging models, and human hair health, and strengthen the research and application of gene technology, regenerative medicine, laser radiofrequency, and other fields in anti-aging. Promote the deep integration of biotechnology such as gene testing and molecular diagnostics with the delay of elderly diseases, and develop early screening products and services for elderly diseases. Promote the research and development of cosmetic raw materials, formula and production process design and development.\"③ Cosmax, Water Sheep, and Baiya released their 2023 performance forecasts. Among them, Cosmax expects the net profit attributable to shareholders of listed companies in 2023 to reach 720 million to 760 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 85.50%-95.80%; the net profit after deducting non-recurring gains and losses is expected to be 703 million to 743 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 85.80%-96.38%. The increase in the volume of sunscreen products and the improvement in capacity utilization have contributed to the company's high performance growth. Water Sheep expects the net profit attributable to shareholders of listed companies in 2023 to reach 280 million to 320 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 124%-156%. The company's own brands, Ifidan, Big Water Drop, and Yuyifang, continue to develop, the agency brand business is deeply bound with Johnson & Johnson, and cooperates with emerging advantageous brands such as KIKO and Mystique, further optimizing the overall business and product structure, promoting the company's sustainable development. Investment suggestions: In terms of cosmetics, under the background of declining industry channel dividends and overall demand performance slowing down, the performance of domestic brands has diverged, with high-quality domestic brands performing brilliantly. Looking ahead, the Japanese nuclear wastewater incident, changes in consumer consumption concepts, and the trend of national fashion provide opportunities and space for domestic cosmetics. Consumers' awareness and demand for domestic products are increasing, the ranking of domestic products is gradually rising, and the penetration rate of domestic products is expected to gradually increase. It is recommended to pay attention to high-quality domestic leading companies such as Proya. In terms of medical aesthetics, the main themes of the medical aesthetics track are still the development of both supply and demand, increased penetration rate, stricter compliance, and increased domestic substitution rate. It is recommended to pay attention to leading companies with rich compliance product lines such as Aimeike and Jiangsu Wuzhong, which are actively deploying in the medical aesthetics track. Risk warning: intensified industry competition, new product launches not meeting expectations, and industry prosperity declining.",

      "information": "The 24-year interim report of the operators has been released, and emerging businesses are building a new growth inflection point. The semi-annual reports of the three major operators were completed this week, and various data indicators and business expansion conditions have maintained a stable and positive trend. From a performance perspective, the financial indicators of the three major operators performed excellently. In the first half of 2024, the operating revenues of Mobile, Unicom, and Telecom reached 546.744 billion yuan, 197.341 billion yuan, and 265.973 billion yuan, respectively, with year-on-year increases of 3.0%, 2.9%, and 2.8%; the net profits attributable to the parent company reached 80.201 billion yuan, 6.039 billion yuan, and 21.812 billion yuan, with year-on-year increases of 5.3%, 10.9%, and 8.2%. On a quarterly basis, the operating revenues of the three major operators in Q2 increased by 1.09%, 3.42%, and 1.98% year-on-year; the net profits attributable to the parent company increased by 5.17%, 13.04%, and 8.59% year-on-year. From a business perspective, for China Mobile, the revenue share of the HBN (home, government, and enterprise, emerging) market reached 45%, a year-on-year increase of 2.3%; the revenue from digital transformation reached 147.1 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 11.0%, and the proportion of main business revenue increased to 31.7% compared to the same period last year. For China Unicom, the revenue from network communication business reached 125.1 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 2.1%, ensuring the company's performance; cloud business revenue reached 31.7 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 24.3%. Overall, the three basic telecom operators achieved revenue of 227.9 billion yuan from emerging businesses such as IPTV, internet data centers, big data, cloud computing, and the internet of things, a year-on-year increase of 11.4%, becoming the most important engine for the company's growth. We believe that the steady growth of traditional C-end business combined with the continuous expansion of B-end business will become the main source of growth for various performance indicators of operators and may further catalyze the construction of a new growth curve for the company.\n\nThe Federal Reserve signals a rate cut, continuing to be optimistic about the forward movement of technology stocks. At the macro level, on August 23, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell said that the time for policy adjustment has come, and the labor market has cooled significantly from its previous overheating state, making it unlikely to become a source of rising inflationary pressure in the short term. According to CME Group's FedWatch data, the market bets that the probability of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by 25 basis points in September is 73.5%, and the probability of cutting interest rates by 50 basis points is 26.5%; the probability of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by a total of 50 basis points by November is 54.2%, the probability of cutting interest rates by a total of 75 basis points is 38.9%, and the probability of cutting interest rates by a total of 100 basis points is 7.0%. Affected by this, the three major U.S. stock indexes all closed higher, and technology companies such as Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon all saw varying degrees of increase. At the micro level, Nvidia will announce its second-quarter results on August 28, Apple plans to launch new iPhones, AirPods, and watches on September 10, and will increase testing efforts for MAC models equipped with M4 processors. We believe that with the rising \"dovish\" voices of the Federal Reserve and the intensified catalysis of news from large North American technology companies, domestic related technology enterprises and software and hardware industry companies are expected to achieve sustained benefits.\n\nRecommended attention: Operators: China Mobile, China Unicom, China Telecom; Optical modules: Zhongji Xuchuang, New Yisheng, Tianfu Communication; Optical chips: Yuanjie Technology, Shijia Photon; Servers: Inspur Information, Sugon, Foxconn Industrial Internet; Chips: Cambricon, Haiguang Information, etc.",

      "information": "In 2019, Zhou, then the investment director of Huitianfu Fund, once recommended Siwei (Shanghai) Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Siwei Biotech) as an investment target for tumor vaccines to Wang, a director of Tibet Pharmaceuticals, but it was not taken seriously at the time, and no contact was made between the two parties. On the evening of May 21, 2020, Guo Dong, general manager of Tibet Pharmaceuticals, and Wang, a director of Tibet Pharmaceuticals, discussed the COVID-19 pandemic and mRNA technology for COVID-19 vaccines with relevant personnel from the Drug Administration. Guo Dong believed that the vaccine project was a good investment opportunity. Wang recalled that Siwei Biotech, recommended by Zhou earlier, had this technology. After discussing with Guo Dong, Wang immediately contacted Zhou, expressing Tibet Pharmaceuticals' interest in developing a COVID-19 vaccine using mRNA technology and inquiring whether there was still an opportunity to invest in Siwei Biotech and collaborate on developing a COVID-19 vaccine. Zhou conveyed Tibet Pharmaceuticals' intention to cooperate with Siwei Biotech on COVID-19 vaccine development to Siwei Biotech's boss, Li Wen. Due to being very satisfied with Tibet Pharmaceuticals' conditions and resources, and coupled with Siwei Biotech's urgent need for funds at the time, Li Wen also had the intention to cooperate, stating that the cooperation matters could be discussed. After Zhou relayed the relevant information to Wang, Guo Dong reported the intention to carry out the COVID-19 vaccine project to Lin, chairman of the controlling shareholder of Tibet Pharmaceuticals, Consun Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited, and the actual controller of Tibet Pharmaceuticals. At the same time, Wang sent the recommendation materials of Siwei Biotech and its COVID-19 vaccine development information to Lin. Lin recognized the team and technology of Siwei Biotech and hoped to have a face-to-face meeting with them, considering that Siwei Biotech had signed a non-exclusive agreement with Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Group and wanted to advance the project as soon as possible. Following Lin's instructions, Wang coordinated the face-to-face meeting with Siwei Biotech's boss, Li Wen, through Zhou. On May 22, through Zhou's mediation, both parties agreed on a meeting time. On the evening of May 26, the actual controller of Tibet Pharmaceuticals and the main person in charge of Siwei Biotech met for the first time to discuss cooperation. Three directors of Tibet Pharmaceuticals and the deputy general manager of Siwei Biotech also attended the meeting. During the meeting, both parties enhanced mutual understanding, discussed cooperation models and cooperation terms, and reached an intention to further advance cooperation on the spot. From May 27 to May 28, both parties conducted specific business negotiations and reached a consensus on the investment amount and transaction plan. From May 29 to May 30, Tibet Pharmaceuticals conducted due diligence on Siwei Biotech. On June 1, both parties signed a formal cooperation agreement. On June 16, Tibet Pharmaceuticals announced an external investment, stating that it had signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Siwei Biotech, intending to pay 351 million yuan in stages to obtain the global exclusive rights to develop, produce, use, and commercialize their COVID-19 vaccine, tuberculosis vaccine, and influenza vaccine, with 350 million yuan for the COVID-19 vaccine and a 35 million yuan advance payment. The transaction amount in the announcement was 351 million yuan, accounting for 14.3% of the latest audited net assets of the listed company. On May 21, 2020, after understanding each other's situation and demands through the intermediary Zhou, both Tibet Pharmaceuticals and the actual controller of Siwei Biotech intended to cooperate and arranged a face-to-face meeting on May 22, which should be recognized as the formation time of insider information according to the law. The sensitive period for insider information was from May 21, 2020, to June 16, 2020. Lu, the director of new drug development at Tianjin Consun Pharmaceutical Technology Development Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Consun Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited, participated in the due diligence work of Tibet Pharmaceuticals on Siwei Biotech on May 29, 2020, and learned the insider information on that day, making him an insider in this case, with the knowledge time no later than May 29, 2020. Mei Jianxun and the insider Lu are husband and wife. According to the investigation, Lu actively called Mei Jianxun five times between May 29 and May 30, 2020, with a total call duration of 243 seconds. The \"Mei Jianxun\" China Merchants Securities account was opened on April 9, 2014, at the China Merchants Securities Tianjin Youyi North Road Securities Business Department. Mei Jianxun actually controlled the \"Mei Jianxun\" China Merchants Securities account, and the mobile phone number used to buy \"Tibet Pharmaceuticals\" stocks was Mei Jianxun's own mobile phone number, with all trading funds coming from his own funds. On June 1, 2020, Mei Jianxun bought 10,500 shares of \"Tibet Pharmaceuticals\" with this account, with a transaction amount of 359,051 yuan. After the announcement was released, he sold 5,000 shares on July 2, 2020, and sold all remaining shares on December 30, 2020. According to the exchange's calculation, the account made a total profit of 374,890.57 yuan from trading \"Tibet Pharmaceuticals\" stocks during the sensitive period. Before buying \"Tibet Pharmaceuticals\" stocks, the \"Mei Jianxun\" China Merchants Securities account had only traded one stock since its opening, with a transaction amount of only 2,000 yuan. The transaction amount of buying \"Tibet Pharmaceuticals\" stocks on June 1, 2020, was 180 times the total transaction amount of previous stock trades, with a significant increase in trading volume, and the proportion of buying \"Tibet Pharmaceuticals\" stocks and the proportion of holdings at the end of the period both exceeded 90%, showing a strong willingness to buy and significantly abnormal trading behavior.",

From February 28 to March 1, 2018, Wang and others visited Tianli Lithium Energy for inspection, and the senior management of Tianli Lithium Energy expressed their hope that Vantone Real Estate would acquire Tianli Lithium Energy. Subsequently, Wang arranged for Vantone Real Estate Director Sun to conduct research with relevant personnel from Hongta Securities. On March 11, 2018, Hongta Securities sent the \"Tianli Lithium Energy M&A Analysis Report V2\", which detailed the industry in which Tianli Lithium Energy is located, capital needs, acquisition plans, etc. As a result, Vantone Real Estate expressed its intention to acquire Tianli Lithium Energy. On April 12, 2018, Vantone Real Estate and Tianli Lithium Energy signed a confidentiality agreement. Then, relevant personnel from Jia Hua Holdings, Hongta Securities, Xinghua Certified Public Accountants, and Wansiheng Law Firm went to Tianli Lithium Energy for due diligence. During the same period, Na Chuan Co., Ltd.'s investee company Qiyuan Na Chuan attempted to acquire the equity of Xingheng Power, but failed to complete it for some reason. At the beginning of 2018, the management of Xingheng Power believed that it was difficult for Na Chuan Co., Ltd. to acquire it, so they conducted a new round of capital increase and share expansion. In mid-April 2018, Jia Hua Holdings, recommended by Tianli Lithium Energy, initially contacted the private placement of Xingheng Power. On April 10, Sun provided Wang with shareholder information of Xingheng Power, mentioning the reasons why Na Chuan Co., Ltd. found it difficult to acquire. After on-site inspections and investigations, Vantone Real Estate believed that Xingheng Power was a very good target.

Subsequently, Zhongke Zhongrui Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (Zhongke Zhongrui) and Zhongrui Holdings (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (Zhongrui Holdings) were also established one after another. Zhongrui Holdings and Haiyang City Urban Development Investment Co., Ltd. (Haiyang Urban Investment) hold 50.1% and 49.9% of Yantai Zhongrui respectively, while Yantai Zhongrui holds 100% of Zhongke Zhongrui. The actual controller and legal representative is Ma Mouzhong. On August 25, 2017, Zhongrui Holdings and Haiyang Urban Investment signed the \"Haiyang City New Energy Industrial Park Project Cooperation Investment Framework Agreement\" to jointly invest in the establishment of an investment platform, aiming to participate in the equity investment of listed companies, and promote the development of the local new energy vehicle industry by becoming an important shareholder or even a controlling shareholder of listed companies. In October 2017, Yantai Zhongrui was established and formulated the \"Yantai Zhongrui Acquisition Project Financing Plan,\" which described the situation of investors (Zhongrui Holdings and Haiyang Urban Investment) and the overview of the target listed company. Although the name of the listed company was not explicitly stated, the description in the plan was completely consistent with the fundamentals and financial data of Meiyan Jixiang Company. At the same time, Zhongrui Holdings formed an anonymous \"Due Diligence Report on Listed Companies\" in October 2017, and the content of the report was completely consistent with the basic situation of Meiyan Jixiang. On November 17, 2017, Yantai Zhongrui held a general meeting of shareholders and determined the specific investment methods, including funds for new energy vehicle project investment and for acquiring shares of listed companies. On the same day, Yantai Zhongrui held a board meeting and authorized Ma Mouzhong to be responsible for the acquisition of shares of listed companies and the execution of external investment projects. From November 2017 to January 2018, Ma Mouzhong consulted lawyer Li Mouli of Deheng Law Firm regarding the legal regulations on increasing holdings of listed company stocks through the secondary market. He discussed with Qian Mouming about finding a shell company with margin financing qualifications and jointly investing in Meiyan Jixiang with Yantai Zhongrui.

      "information": "January 19, 2024, from a technical analysis perspective, after the stock index accelerated its decline at the end of October last year and hit a new low for the year, it once showed a stable and gradual upward trend. The stock index experienced a technical rebound with a wave of oscillating upward movement. However, as the stock index repeatedly failed to challenge the 60-day moving average, it turned from strong to weak and showed a trend of oscillating decline, indicating that a round of oversold technical rebound had come to an end. At the beginning of the new year, the stock index continued its weak trend and accelerated its decline, with several major indices continuously falling and hitting new lows for the year, causing market confidence to suffer another severe blow. This week, the stock index continuously oscillated and adjusted. On Thursday, under the background of a general decline on Wednesday, the stock index accelerated its decline again and hit a new low for the year. The continuous sharp decline triggered a tentative entry of bottom-fishing funds from outside the market. The bulls leveraged the heavyweight stocks to create a trend of first suppressing and then rising. The significantly enlarged trading volume indicated a large divergence and fierce competition between the bulls and bears. The single-day bottoming out with increased volume on Thursday basically confirmed the short-term low point of the stock index. However, we also need to see the shortcomings of Thursday, that is, although the stock index turned red and rose, the number of declining stocks still significantly exceeded the number of rising stocks, indicating that the rise on Thursday was still dominated by heavyweight stocks. Currently, the short- and medium-term moving averages have formed a divergent bearish arrangement after converging, still exerting layer-by-layer resistance to the upward movement of the stock index. Although, as we expected, the stock index rebounded and rose on Thursday after continuously accelerating its decline, the overall weak characteristic of the market has not changed. The rise on Thursday was more based on a technical rebound after the stock index was continuously oversold. Therefore, it is expected that short-term wide fluctuations in the stock index may be unavoidable. Closely monitor the trends of the RMB exchange rate and the popularity index, grasp the market rhythm, control positions, and select individual stocks for operation.",

      "information": "Insurance: Premiums under short-term pressure, expected continuous improvement in the medium to long term, optimistic outlook on the asset side. 1) The Financial Supervision Administration disclosed the operating data of the insurance industry in November. The decline in life insurance narrowed marginally, and auto insurance continued to grow rapidly. In November, the monthly premium of life insurance companies decreased by 0.5% year-on-year, with a significant narrowing of the decline; health insurance premiums decreased by 3.1% year-on-year; property insurance premiums increased by 5.9% year-on-year, with stable growth in auto insurance premiums and a rebound in non-auto insurance growth. By the end of November, the industry's investment asset scale reached 27.3 trillion yuan, an increase of 9% from the beginning of the year; bank deposits/bonds/stocks and funds/others (non-standard, etc.) accounted for 9.7%/44.6%/12.4%/33.3% respectively. The proportion of stocks and funds remained basically unchanged from the beginning of the year, bonds increased by 3.7 percentage points, bank deposits decreased by 1.6 percentage points, and others (non-standard, etc.) decreased by 1.8 percentage points. 2) Some insurance companies are continuously lowering the settlement interest rates of universal insurance. According to media reports, some insurance companies have lowered the settlement interest rate of universal insurance from 4.5% to 4%, some companies have lowered it from 4% to 3.5%, and a few companies have lowered it to 3%. Lowering the settlement interest rate of universal insurance is an independent action by the industry to reduce liability costs based on market conditions. In the context of a downward trend in market interest rates, some insurance companies have chosen to lower the settlement interest rate of universal insurance to prevent interest rate spread risk. This will further improve the transmission mechanism between the investment side and the liability side of insurance companies, releasing more space for insurance companies to serve the real economy. 3) The insurance industry's operations have significant pro-cyclical characteristics. In the future, as the economy recovers, both the liability side and the investment side will significantly improve. As of January 12, 2024, the valuation of the insurance sector is 0.32-0.64 times the 2023E P/EV, still at a historical low, maintaining an \"outperform\" rating.",

      "information": "Currently, the driving factors for the price of onshore and offshore wind turbine units are mainly the large-scale capacity of the turbines, rather than the mere continuation of a \"price war.\" The large-scale capacity of the units is an important way to reduce costs and increase efficiency for the entire machine, reflecting the technical competitiveness of the complete machine manufacturers. It also places higher demands on core components such as towers and main shafts, highlighting the competitive advantages of leading wind turbine and core component manufacturers. In addition, with the development of offshore wind power, the demand for large-megawatt units is gradually increasing, and related companies will benefit significantly. 1) In the complete machine segment, we recommend Mingyang Smart, Sany Heavy Energy, and Windey Co., with beneficiaries including Goldwind and Shanghai Electric Wind Power; 2) In the key components segment, we recommend Jinlei Technology, Orient Cable, and Titan Wind Energy, with beneficiaries including Tianshun Wind Energy, Dajin Heavy Industry, Haili Wind Power, and Riyue Co.\n\nThe price of onshore wind turbine units fluctuates widely, with significant price differences between different projects. According to information released by the China Public Tendering Service Platform, we have calculated that in December 2023, the average winning bid price for onshore wind turbine units (excluding tower tubes) was 1585 yuan/kW, a month-on-month increase of 13.16%; since January 2024, the average winning bid price for onshore wind turbine units (excluding tower tubes) has been 1327 yuan/kW, a month-on-month decrease of 16.32%. The main reason for the wide fluctuations in onshore wind turbine prices is the significant differences between projects, especially the relatively low average prices of the \"Three North\" large base projects.\n\nThe price of offshore wind turbine units has dropped significantly, with the lowest bid price falling below 2600 yuan/kW. According to information released by \"Wind Energy,\" since January 2024, at least two offshore wind turbine projects have seen the lowest bid prices fall below 2600 yuan/kW, including: the 2024 Wind Turbine Framework Shortlist Centralized Procurement Project by China Power Construction (with a capacity of 3GW for the offshore wind project in package three, the lowest bid price was 7.35 billion yuan, equivalent to 2450 yuan/kW, opened on January 9, 2024), and the first phase of the 304MW offshore wind farm project on Yuetuo Island, Laoting, Tangshan by China Guodian (the lowest bid price was 2599.4 yuan/kW, opened on January 11, 2024).\n\nThe large-scale capacity of offshore wind turbine units is accelerating again, with single-unit capacity expected to reach 25MW. Recently, the Fujian Provincial Development and Reform Commission officially approved the national offshore wind power research and testing base project in the D and E areas off the coast of Changle. This project is located in the sea area east of Dongquan Island, Changle, and is being constructed by Fujian Huayi New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. The project includes the construction of 20 offshore wind test foundation platforms, including two 16MW units, three 18MW units, ten 20MW units, and five 25MW units, marking that China's 25MW offshore wind turbine units are now on the agenda.\n\nRisk Warning: Downstream demand release is less than expected, intensified internal industry competition risk, wind turbine quality risk, upstream raw material price increase risk.",

      "information": "January 19, 2024, from a technical analysis perspective, after the stock index accelerated its decline at the end of October last year and hit a new low for the year, it once showed a stable and gradual upward trend. The stock index experienced a wave of technical rebound with oscillations, but due to multiple unsuccessful attempts to challenge the 60-day moving average, the stock index turned from strong to weak and showed a trend of oscillating decline, indicating that a round of oversold technical rebound had come to an end. At the beginning of the new year, the stock index continued its weak trend and accelerated its decline, with several major indices continuously falling and hitting new lows for the year, causing market confidence to be severely hit again. This week, the stock index continuously oscillated and adjusted. On Thursday, under the background of a general decline on Wednesday, the stock index accelerated its decline again and hit a new low for the year. The continuous sharp decline triggered a tentative entry of bottom-fishing funds from outside the market. The bulls, leveraging the heavyweight stocks, showed a trend of first suppressing and then rising. The significantly enlarged trading volume indicated a large divergence and fierce competition between the bulls and bears. The single needle bottoming out with increased volume on Thursday basically confirmed the short-term low point of the stock index, but we also need to see the shortcomings of Thursday, that is, although the stock index turned red and rose, the number of declining stocks still significantly exceeded the number of rising stocks, indicating that the rise on Thursday was still dominated by heavyweight stocks. Currently, the short- and medium-term moving averages have formed a divergent bearish arrangement after converging, still forming layers of resistance to the upward movement of the stock index. Although, as we expected, the stock index rebounded and rose on Thursday after continuously accelerating its decline, the overall weak characteristic of the market has not changed. Thursday's rise was more based on a technical rebound after the stock index was continuously oversold. Therefore, it is expected that short-term wide oscillations of the stock index may be unavoidable. Closely monitor the trends of the RMB exchange rate and the sentiment index, grasp the market rhythm, control positions, and select individual stocks for operation.",

      "information": "Insurance: Premiums under short-term pressure, expected continuous improvement in the medium to long term, optimistic outlook on the asset side. 1) The Financial Supervisory Authority disclosed the operating data of the insurance industry for November. The decline in life insurance has marginally narrowed, and auto insurance continues to grow rapidly. In November, the monthly premium of life insurance companies decreased by 0.5% year-on-year, with a significant narrowing of the decline; health insurance premiums decreased by 3.1% year-on-year; property insurance premiums increased by 5.9% year-on-year, with stable growth in auto insurance premiums and a rebound in the growth rate of non-auto insurance. By the end of November, the industry's investment asset scale reached 27.3 trillion yuan, an increase of 9% from the beginning of the year; bank deposits/bonds/stocks and funds/others (non-standard, etc.) accounted for 9.7%/44.6%/12.4%/33.3%, respectively. The proportion of stocks and funds remained basically flat compared to the beginning of the year, bonds increased by 3.7 percentage points, bank deposits decreased by 1.6 percentage points, and others (non-standard, etc.) decreased by 1.8 percentage points. 2) Some insurance companies are continuously lowering the settlement interest rates of universal insurance. According to media reports, some insurance companies have lowered the settlement interest rates of universal insurance from 4.5% to 4%, some companies have lowered it from 4% to 3.5%, and a few companies have lowered it to 3%. Lowering the settlement interest rate of universal insurance is an independent action by the industry to reduce liability costs based on market conditions. In the context of a downward trend in market interest rates, some insurance companies have chosen to lower the settlement interest rates of universal insurance to prevent interest rate spread risk. This will further improve the transmission mechanism between the investment side and the liability side of insurance companies, releasing more space for insurance companies to serve the real economy. 3) The insurance industry has significant pro-cyclical characteristics. In the future, with economic recovery, both the liability side and the investment side will significantly improve. As of January 12, 2024, the valuation of the insurance sector is 0.32-0.64 times 2023E P/EV, still at a historical low, maintaining an \"outperform\" rating.",

Last week, the overall trading heat of hot topics remained stable, with the average daily turnover rate slightly falling to 2.42%. The week-on-week decline in technology and industry-related themes narrowed. New energy and new technology-related themes such as perovskite and POE film led the gains, followed by lithium battery-related themes. Artificial intelligence, digital assets, consumer electronics, and information innovation-related themes continued the correction trend from the previous week, with significant net outflows in technology leaders and information innovation themes. Currently, we are in a period of incremental policy and flat economic data, with risk preference and micro trading structure having a significant impact on theme performance. The marginal reduction in industry catalysts has increased the pressure on existing themes to correct. Theme selection should still avoid existing themes with deteriorating trading structures, while favoring new tracks with industrial policy and new product and application catalysts.",

      "information": "Currently, the driving factors for the price of onshore and offshore wind turbine units are mainly the large-scale capacity of the turbines, rather than the mere continuation of a \"price war.\" The large-scale capacity of the units is an important way to reduce costs and increase efficiency for the entire machine, reflecting the technical competitiveness of the complete machine manufacturers. It also places higher demands on core components such as towers and main shafts, highlighting the competitive advantages of leading wind turbine and core component manufacturers. In addition, with the development of offshore wind power, the demand for large-megawatt units is gradually increasing, and related companies will benefit significantly. 1) In the complete machine segment, we recommend Mingyang Smart, Sany Heavy Energy, and Windey Co., with beneficiaries including Goldwind and Shanghai Electric Wind Power; 2) In the key components segment, we recommend Jinlei Technology, Orient Cable, and Titan Wind Energy, with beneficiaries including Titan Wind Energy, Dajin Heavy Industry, Haili Wind Power, and Riyue Heavy Industry.\n\nThe price of onshore wind turbine units fluctuates widely, with significant differences in turbine prices for different projects. According to information released by the China Public Tendering Service Platform, our statistics show that in December 2023, the average winning bid price for onshore wind turbine units (excluding tower tubes) was 1585 yuan/kW, a month-on-month increase of 13.16%; since January 2024, the average winning bid price for onshore wind turbines (excluding tower tubes) has been 1327 yuan/kW, a month-on-month decrease of 16.32%. The main reason for the wide fluctuations in onshore wind turbine prices is the significant differences between projects, especially the relatively low average prices of the \"Three North\" large base projects.\n\nThe price of offshore wind turbine units has dropped significantly, with the lowest bid price falling below 2600 yuan/kW. According to information released by \"Wind Energy,\" since January 2024, at least two offshore wind turbine projects have seen the lowest bid prices fall below 2600 yuan/kW, including: the 2024 Wind Turbine Framework Shortlist Centralized Procurement Project by China Power Construction (with a capacity of 3GW for the offshore wind project in package three, the lowest bid price is 7.35 billion yuan, equivalent to 2450 yuan/kW, bid opening on January 9, 2024), and the first phase of the 304MW offshore wind farm project at Yuetuo Island, Laoting, Tangshan by Guodian (the lowest bid price is 2599.4 yuan/kW, bid opening on January 11, 2024).\n\nThe large-scale capacity of offshore wind turbine units is accelerating again, with single-unit capacity expected to reach 25MW. Recently, the Fujian Provincial Development and Reform Commission officially approved the national offshore wind power research and testing base project in the offshore areas D and E of Changle. This project is located in the sea area east of Dongquan Island, Changle, and is being constructed by Fujian Huayi New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. The project will build 20 offshore wind test foundation platforms, including two 16MW units, three 18MW units, ten 20MW units, and five 25MW units, marking that China's 25MW offshore wind turbine units are now on the agenda.\n\nRisk Warning: Lower-than-expected downstream demand release, intensified internal industry competition, wind turbine quality risks, and upstream raw material price increase risks.",

As a high-tech enterprise providing comprehensive intelligent transportation services, the company holds the \"Highway Traffic Engineering (Highway Electromechanical Engineering) Professional Contracting First-Class Qualification\" and \"Highway Traffic Engineering (Highway Safety Facilities) Professional Contracting First-Class Qualification\" issued by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the \"Excellent Level (CS4) in Information System Construction and Service Capability\" issued by the China Electronic Information Industry Federation, and has passed multiple certifications including ISO9001 Quality Management System Certification, ISO14001 Environmental Management System Certification, and CMMI Maturity Level 3 Certification. The company belongs to the information transmission, software and information technology (I)-software and information technology service industry (I65)-information system integration service (I652)-information system integration service (I6520), and was listed on August 18, 2022. For financial assets or financial liabilities with active markets, the company determines their fair value based on quotations in active markets. For financial instruments without active markets, the company determines their fair value using valuation techniques.\nWhen measuring non-financial assets at fair value, the ability of market participants to generate economic benefits by using the asset for its best use or by selling it to other market participants who can use it for its best use is considered.\nThe company uses valuation techniques that are applicable under current circumstances and supported by sufficient available data and other information, prioritizing relevant observable inputs, and only using unobservable inputs when observable inputs are not available or not feasible.\nFor assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements, the fair value level to which they belong is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the overall fair value measurement: Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are obtainable on the measurement date; Level 2 inputs are observable inputs for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, other than Level 1 inputs; Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The company has accumulated rich project experience in the field of intelligent transportation, with the scale of business bids often ranking at the forefront of the market. In recent years, with the promotion of intelligent transportation projects, the industry's comprehensive requirements for the technical strength, financial strength, and transportation construction experience of midstream integrators have significantly increased. In addition to traditional intelligent transportation system integrators, various types of enterprises have also rapidly entered this market segment. For example, upstream ICT (Information and Communication Technology) equipment giants and internet companies hope to extend their advantageous businesses backward, participating in market competition through joint bidding or even independent bidding to directly provide complete solutions for intelligent transportation systems; regional transportation investment groups or highway companies also hope to complete digital transformation and expand their business chains forward, setting up information technology subsidiaries to directly participate in related project construction; large state-owned enterprises such as communication operators and transportation construction units have also become highly competitive industry participants by leveraging their financial and specialized technical advantages. The intensification of industry competition may not only compress the profit margins of the business but also potentially eliminate companies in unfavorable competitive positions. Although the company currently has advantages in technology, experience, and talent over newer entrants, if the company cannot effectively respond to changes in industry development trends in terms of products and services, research and development, and market expansion, it may face the risk of weakened competitiveness and reduced market share, which could adversely affect the company's operating performance. In 2022, the national highway completed fixed asset investment of 2.9 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 9.7%, with national transportation infrastructure investment moderately ahead. As of the end of 2022, the total mileage of highways in China reached 5.35 million kilometers, including 177,000 kilometers of expressways, indicating a broad market prospect for highway digital construction. In July 2022, the Central Political Bureau meeting emphasized maintaining the momentum of accelerating infrastructure investment and supporting local governments in using special bond funds to sustain high growth in infrastructure investment. Since 2021, the Ministry of Transport, in conjunction with relevant national ministries and commissions, has successively issued policy documents such as the \"Outline of the Medium and Long-term Development Plan for Scientific and Technological Innovation in the Transportation Field (2021-2035)\", the \"Outline of the National Comprehensive Three-dimensional Transportation Network Plan\", and the \"14th Five-Year Plan for Digital Transportation Development\", making the application scenarios of China's intelligent transportation market more extensive. Under the background of new infrastructure and accelerating the construction of a strong transportation country, the intelligent transportation industry is expected to grow steadily and rapidly.\nIn recent years, with the development of intelligent highway construction, the market size of China's intelligent highway transportation industry has been continuously expanding: the market size increased from 93.7 billion yuan in 2017 to 138.24 billion yuan in 2021, with a compound annual growth rate of 10.2%, and is expected to grow to 283.73 billion yuan in 2026, with a compound annual growth rate of 15.5%. Since 2019, China has canceled provincial toll stations on expressways, and the ETC electronic toll collection system has ushered in a wave of popularity, with intelligent highway transportation construction reaching a phased peak during the \"13th Five-Year Plan\" period. During the \"14th Five-Year Plan\" period, China will focus on increasing investment in the informatization and digitalization of transportation infrastructure, promoting the integration of new-generation information technologies such as cloud computing, big data, the Internet of Things, mobile internet, blockchain, and artificial intelligence with transportation, which will bring new growth opportunities for China's intelligent transportation construction.",

The overseas first-class mining assets invested in include Brazil Mining and Metallurgy Company, Peru's Bambas Copper Mine, and Ivanhoe Mines. The high-quality domestic assets invested in include Western Superconducting Technologies and Zhongbo Shijin. In 2022, the company's operating income was 119.2 billion yuan. According to the \"2022 China Top 500 Enterprises\" list released by the China Enterprise Confederation and the China Enterprise Directors Association, it can be ranked 215th (CITIC Metal does not participate in the ranking separately, and the data is consolidated into CITIC Group for ranking).\n\nCITIC Metal actively builds a global supply chain service network, vigorously develops the trade of bulk commodities in metals and minerals, relies on upstream resource advantages, fully leverages the promotion role of copper and niobium mine investments in bulk commodity trade, and makes positive contributions to ensuring the security of the national metal and mineral supply chain and industrial chain. Currently, China's economic operation faces new complex challenges from both international and domestic fronts. Internationally, the geopolitical landscape is undergoing profound adjustments, the external environment is complex and severe, economic growth remains sluggish, supply chain and industrial chain are under impact, international trade and investment are slowing down, global inflation is high, the tightening effects of central bank policies in developed countries are emerging, international trade and investment are slowing down, international market demand is weakening, external demand continues to weaken, and risks in the global economic and financial fields are accumulating. Domestically, the current improvement in China's economic operation is mainly restorative, endogenous motivation is still not strong, demand is still insufficient, and economic transformation and upgrading face new resistance. However, overall, China's development foundation is solid, market potential is huge, policy effects are emerging, and the long-term positive fundamentals of the economy have not changed.\n\nIn terms of bulk commodity trade, influenced by factors such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, US dollar interest rate hikes, insufficient demand, and the coexistence of high interest rates and economic slowdown, global bulk commodity prices have fluctuated significantly, with an overall downward trend. Meanwhile, domestic industries such as real estate and infrastructure still have weak demand for bulk commodities, metal and mineral prices, especially ferrous metals like steel, have declined, and the growth rate of demand for non-ferrous metals still has some uncertainties. In the first half of the year, the US dollar to RMB exchange rate fluctuated significantly in the range of 6.71-7.23. At the beginning of the year, the RMB exchange rate against the US dollar once appreciated to 6.7099. Subsequently, the continuous interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, changes in the Russia-Ukraine situation, and other factors pushed up the US dollar index. Coupled with the domestic economic recovery falling short of expectations, the RMB exchange rate fluctuated widely and weakened, returning to around 7.2.",

      "information": "The functional carbon-based materials industry has relatively high technical requirements. Companies in the industry must continuously invest in R&D and constantly develop new technologies and products to effectively meet the production needs of downstream customers and maintain market competitiveness. In the future, if the issuer's new products and new technology R&D fail, or if competitors achieve technological breakthroughs first and launch products with more advanced processes, better performance, lower costs, and greater competitiveness, it will affect the issuer's market competitiveness, thereby leading to a decline in profitability. The development of new technologies and new products relies on an excellent and stable technical R&D team. With the development of the issuer's business and the implementation of the R&D center construction project, the issuer's demand for high-quality technical R&D personnel will further increase. If effective measures are not taken to ensure the stability of core technical personnel and to motivate technical R&D personnel, it may lead to the loss of core technical personnel and even the leakage of core technologies, which will adversely affect the issuer's ability to maintain core competitiveness. During each reporting period, the issuer's operating income was 136.0177 million yuan, 303.0129 million yuan, 438.6469 million yuan, and 260.1545 million yuan, respectively, with a compound growth rate of 79.58% from 2020 to 2022, indicating a rapid growth rate. During the reporting period, the issuer's products were mainly applied in the photovoltaic crystalline silicon manufacturing field, and the performance growth was mainly due to the rapid development of the photovoltaic industry. During each reporting period, the revenue proportions of the company's top five customers (calculated on a consolidated basis under the same control) were 74.32%, 51.12%, 49.20%, and 46.42%, respectively, indicating a high customer concentration. The company's products are currently mainly applied in the photovoltaic crystalline silicon manufacturing field, and the high customer concentration is mainly due to the high concentration in the downstream photovoltaic crystalline silicon manufacturing industry. During each reporting period, the proportion of the company's procurement amount from the top five raw material and outsourced processing suppliers to the total procurement amount of raw materials and outsourced processing was 84.99%, 81.91%, 60.42%, and 63.41%, respectively, indicating a relatively concentrated supplier base. In the future, if the company's cooperation with major suppliers undergoes adverse changes, and the stability, timeliness, and price levels of raw material supply cannot be guaranteed, it will adversely affect the company's production and operations. As of the signing date of this prospectus, the issuer has leased properties that have not been registered for lease filing, and some leased properties have not obtained property ownership certificates. In future business operations, if the issuer incurs additional expenses due to the aforementioned unregistered lease filings, property ownership defects, or the lessor's lack of authority to lease the relevant properties, resulting in abnormal termination of leases, inability to renew leases, or relocation, it may have a certain degree of adverse impact on the issuer and its subsidiaries' business and financial conditions.",

      "information": "The company is mainly engaged in the research and development, design, production, sales, and maintenance services of electrical drive and control equipment in the field of industrial automation. Its core product is the integrated variable frequency drive, making it one of the few manufacturers in the country capable of designing and producing such devices. To better meet the ever-increasing demands of downstream customers for product performance, quality, application industries, and application scenarios, the company needs to continuously innovate and iterate its products to meet the requirements of market competition and development. If the company's future technological research and development fail, leading to lagging product performance, it may result in a decline in the company's market competitiveness, thereby adversely affecting the company's performance. The issuer's controlling shareholder and actual controller, Mr. Deng Kefei, directly holds 83.81% of the issuer's shares before this issuance and will still control more than two-thirds of the issuer's voting rights after this issuance, maintaining an absolute controlling position with the ability to exert significant influence on the issuer's major business and financial decisions. If Mr. Deng Kefei uses his position as the actual controller and his influence on the issuer to improperly control major issues such as the issuer's business management and external investments through exercising voting rights, it may harm the interests of the issuer and other shareholders. After the implementation of the fundraising investment projects, the company's fixed asset scale will increase significantly, and the asset structure will undergo substantial changes. The company will increase the original value of fixed assets by 672.8877 million yuan, accounting for 76.89% of the total investment, which will lead to a significant increase in fixed asset depreciation, adversely affecting the company's net profit. If future market demand changes, the increased depreciation brought by fixed asset investment will put pressure on the company's future performance. During the reporting period, the company's main raw materials were power modules, electrical components, housings, steel, copper, silicon steel sheets, etc., with the risk of raw material price increases. The company's key raw material is the IGBT in power modules, with procurement amounts during the reporting period of 40.6887 million yuan, 32.3517 million yuan, 69.2838 million yuan, and 41.6692 million yuan, accounting for 13.74%, 8.00%, 10.29%, and 13.18% of the total raw material procurement, respectively. IGBT is a core component of energy conversion and transmission. The IGBT brands currently used by the company mainly include Switzerland's ABB, Germany's Infineon, and Zhuzhou CRRC. During the reporting period, the proportion of foreign brands in the company's IGBT procurement was 58.44%, 78.61%, 75.92%, and 35.31%, respectively. If international trade frictions continue to escalate or other bilateral trade frictions occur, and the aforementioned countries prohibit or restrict relevant manufacturers from supplying IGBT products to China, it will adversely affect the stability and cost of the company's raw material supply. The main products produced and sold by the company are integrated variable frequency drives, special frequency converters, special motors, electrical control, and power supply products. The company takes the integrated variable frequency drive as its core product, with sales revenue of integrated variable frequency drives accounting for the highest proportion of main business income during the reporting period, at 56.95%, 64.49%, 51.95%, and 62.68%, respectively. Currently, the company is one of the few domestic companies capable of designing and producing integrated variable frequency drives. However, as other domestic manufacturers successfully develop and produce integrated variable frequency drives, industry competition will intensify, which may lead to a decline in the company's profitability.",

      "information": "2020-2023, the company's operating income was 512.1154 million yuan, 653.8153 million yuan, 721.1337 million yuan, and 627 million yuan (forecast value, unaudited), and the net profit attributable to shareholders of the parent company was 26.9542 million yuan, 27.1314 million yuan, 72.5889 million yuan, and 73.5 million yuan (forecast value, unaudited). During the reporting period, the issuer's overall business situation improved, with operating income increasing year by year from 2020 to 2022, and revenue in 2023 decreasing by 13.05% year-on-year (forecast value, unaudited). This was partly due to reduced demand from customers such as ZTE, Gongjin, TP-LINK, etc., affected by their business conditions and market environment, and partly due to the issuer's continued efforts. During the reporting period, the company's export revenue was 124.7416 million yuan, 166.4177 million yuan, 191.4409 million yuan, and 99.773 million yuan, accounting for 27.95%, 29.45%, 30.21%, and 36.77% of the company's main business income, respectively. During the reporting period, the company's confirmed exchange gains and losses (negative numbers are gains) were 3.8424 million yuan, 1.9595 million yuan, -6.0077 million yuan, and -4.3468 million yuan, accounting for 13.37%, 7.37%, -7.96%, and -11.97% of the total profit for the period, respectively. If there are significant fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate in the future, the company will face the risk of exchange losses due to changes in the RMB exchange rate, which will adversely affect the company's profitability. Connectors are the connecting bridge in electronic circuits and belong to basic components, and their development is highly correlated with the international macroeconomic situation. Macroeconomic fluctuations will have varying degrees of impact on downstream industries such as communications, industrial control, and new energy, thereby affecting the demand for connectors. Currently, the global economy is still in a cyclical fluctuation, coupled with factors such as geopolitical conflicts, inflation, and trade frictions, there is a certain degree of uncertainty in the global economic recovery. If the global economic situation further deteriorates and Sino-US trade frictions intensify in the future, it may have a certain degree of adverse impact on the company's product sales and equipment imports, thereby affecting the company's performance. The global connector industry is highly market-oriented. From the market structure perspective, the top ten manufacturers of connectors are mainly occupied by companies from Europe, America, Japan, etc., and are gradually showing a trend of concentration. The company has been operating in the connector industry for nearly twenty years, but compared with international giants, the company has a significant gap in terms of operating scale and market share. With international connector giants gradually expanding their domestic OEM scale, developing the Chinese market, and domestic connector companies expanding production, future market competition may intensify. If the company fails to continuously improve in technology research and development, production processes, product quality, response speed, market marketing, etc., in the increasingly fierce market competition, it may lead to a decline in the company's market competitiveness, thereby adversely affecting the company's future operating performance. The company's external procurement mainly includes raw materials such as metal materials, plastic materials, and terminal electroplating services. Procurement prices are affected by factors such as upstream metal mining, transportation costs, and market supply and demand relationships. During the reporting period, the proportion of the company's direct material costs to the current main business costs was 58.10%, 60.66%, 58.25%, and 55.23%, respectively, with a high proportion of material costs. If raw material prices rise in the future and the company fails to timely pass on the price increase to customers or reduce the impact through advance stocking, there will be a risk of a decline in operating performance.",

      "information": "The company mainly engages in the research and development, production, and sales of hydraulic components and parts, with products primarily used in industries such as construction machinery. The development of the aforementioned industries is significantly influenced by changes in national and even global macroeconomic conditions and industrial structure adjustments, and is highly sensitive to economic prosperity. Therefore, the hydraulic industry is prone to cyclical fluctuations due to macroeconomic cycles. When the macroeconomy is in an upward cycle, there is usually strong demand for fixed asset investment and significant expansion in investment scale, leading to rapid development in downstream industries such as construction machinery, which in turn drives the rapid development of the hydraulic industry. Conversely, when the macroeconomy is in a downward cycle, if the demand for fixed asset investment is sluggish and the market scale shrinks, the development of downstream industries such as construction machinery faces pressure, and the development of the hydraulic industry also slows down accordingly. Therefore, the industry in which the company operates is subject to the risk of being affected by macroeconomic cyclical fluctuations. \n\nDomestic hydraulic enterprises in China are characterized by a large number of companies, generally small scale, relatively weak financial strength, slightly insufficient technical strength, and overall weak competitiveness, with a certain gap compared to international leading hydraulic enterprises. Currently, the company may face the risk of intensified market competition in the future. On one hand, if international leading hydraulic enterprises increase their efforts to expand in the Chinese market, it will put significant pressure on the market space of domestic brands; on the other hand, if other domestic competitors increase their research and development and production efforts, or if new entrants from upstream and downstream industries participate in the hydraulic components industry, it will lead to intensified competition within the industry, which may squeeze the market share of the company's products, potentially leading to a decline in the company's market share and profit levels.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2021, benefiting from strong demand in downstream industries such as construction machinery and the company's increased market expansion efforts, the company's operating income was 700.2315 million yuan and 842.3492 million yuan respectively, and the net profit attributable to shareholders of the parent company after deducting non-recurring gains and losses was 133.4831 million yuan and 148.0052 million yuan respectively, with both operating income and net profit maintaining growth in each period. In 2022, due to factors such as the slowdown in demand in domestic downstream industries such as construction machinery, the company's operating income was 706.7063 million yuan, and the net profit attributable to shareholders of the parent company after deducting non-recurring gains and losses was 140.9809 million yuan. In the future, if there is a decline in the macroeconomic and downstream industries such as construction machinery, intensified market competition, a significant increase in the prices of the company's main raw materials, and failure to timely expand the downstream customer market, and if the company fails to respond in a timely manner, it will affect the company's production and operation, and there is a risk of a decline in the company's operating performance.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2022, the sales revenue from the company's top five customers accounted for 75.24%, 73.02%, and 75.05% of the operating income for the respective periods. The company's main products include oil tanks, hard pipes, and metal fittings, mainly used in fields such as construction machinery, with major customers including large original equipment manufacturers in the construction machinery industry such as Caterpillar, Volvo, Komatsu, XCMG Group, Liugong Group, and Kobelco Construction Machinery. In the future, if the cooperative relationship with major customers deteriorates, customers increase their procurement from other suppliers, or if the operating performance of major customers declines significantly, reducing procurement volume, it will adversely affect the company's operating performance.",

      "information": "LED and semiconductor packaging and testing equipment technology research and development need to closely follow the development trends of downstream industries, comprehensively developing new devices and new functions. If the company's technology research and development deviates from the development direction of downstream application industries, fails to track and develop cutting-edge technologies in the equipment industry in a timely manner, or some new technological achievements cannot be completed in time, it will adversely affect the company's business development. The company places great emphasis on building a team of highly educated talents. If the company cannot continuously improve a competitive salary system and a good talent training and reserve system in the future, it may lead to the loss of key technical personnel and insufficient talent reserves, which will adversely affect the company's technological innovation. Currently, the company's downstream customers are mainly LED packaging manufacturers, and the concentration of the LED packaging industry is relatively high. During the reporting period, the sales amount of the company's top five customers accounted for 53.66%, 62.30%, 72.97%, and 80.34% of the operating income, respectively, indicating a high customer concentration. If the operating environment of the company's customers is adversely affected by industry competition, macroeconomic factors, or if customers adjust their supply chain structure in the future, the company's operating performance will be adversely affected. The company's main product, the wire bonding machine, has a high difficulty in quality control and is used in key processes of LED and semiconductor packaging and testing. As the company's business continues to expand, product models continue to diversify, and downstream customers' requirements for product quality continue to increase, the company's quality control work will face greater challenges. If the company cannot continuously maintain a comprehensive, complete, and effective quality control system or if the corresponding quality control measures are not effectively implemented, resulting in substandard products, defects, and other quality issues leading to returns or customer complaints, it may adversely affect the company's cooperation with existing customers and future business expansion. During the reporting period, the direct materials in the company's main business costs were 83.43 million yuan, 199.01 million yuan, 258.98 million yuan, and 114.68 million yuan, accounting for 90.09%, 92.85%, 93.95%, and 93.47% of the main business costs for each period, respectively. The company has established stable cooperative relationships with major suppliers, and the market supply of relevant raw materials is sufficient and prices are relatively stable. However, if major suppliers experience significant adverse changes in production and operation, or if the supply quality and delivery time do not meet the company's requirements, or if there are adverse changes in the business relationship with the company, the company may face the risk of raw material shortages affecting normal production and operation in the short term. In addition, if the market prices of major raw materials increase significantly, it will also adversely affect the company's product gross profit margin. The development of the LED and semiconductor packaging and testing equipment industry is not only affected by its own industrial policies but also by the industrial policies of upstream and downstream industries. In recent years, China has introduced multiple rounds of policies to strongly support the related industries of LED and semiconductor packaging and testing equipment. However, if the national policy support weakens in the future, it may have a certain negative impact on the company.",

      "information": "The main terminal application field corresponding to the company's downstream customers is the wind power industry. The company's product sales are greatly affected by the installed capacity of the terminal wind power industry. Affected by the \"installation rush,\" the company's operating income in 2020 increased by 237.49% compared to 2019. After the \"grid parity\" of onshore wind power in China in 2021, the pressure on the entire wind power industry chain to \"reduce costs\" increased, and the price of blade core materials decreased; at the same time, the installed capacity of domestic wind power also fluctuated to a certain extent compared to 2020, resulting in a 36.35% decrease in the company's operating income in 2021 compared to 2020.\nIf the subsequent demand for new installed capacity in the wind power industry continues to slow down or decline, leading to a significant drop in the company's income from the wind power industry, or if the profitability of the company's wind power blade core material products declines significantly, it may have a significant adverse impact on the company's operating performance. The company's operating performance is subject to the risk of fluctuations due to changes in the prosperity of downstream industries. During the reporting period, the company's comprehensive gross profit margins after deducting the impact of freight were 49.34%, 33.06%, 33.36%, and 31.74%, respectively. The company's product prices and gross profit margins are affected by various factors such as the macroeconomic environment, the status of downstream customer industries, sales conditions, and production costs. Since May 2019, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Energy Bureau have successively introduced a series of wind power grid parity policies. The wind power industry will enter the era of competitive bidding for grid access. The withdrawal of subsidies and competitive bidding for grid access will lead to lower electricity prices, which will in turn lead to lower wind power bidding prices, thereby compressing the profit margins of wind power blade manufacturers and complete machine manufacturers, putting pressure on the entire wind power industry chain to \"reduce costs,\" which may lead to a decrease in the sales prices of the company's products and thus a decrease in gross profit margins. In recent years, with the rapid development of the wind power industry, structural foam materials, as an important raw material for wind power blades, have seen strong market demand. Currently, the main competitors in the domestic wind power blade PVC foam industry include the issuer, Sweden's Diab, Italy's Maricell, etc.; PET foam also includes regional companies with certain production capacity and market recognition, such as Shanghai Yueke.\nIf existing companies compete for market share through price reductions or other means, leading to intensified industry competition, or if downstream demand decreases due to macroeconomic factors, or if competitors develop more competitive products, offer better prices or services, it will intensify industry competition and affect the market share of the company's structural foam materials, thereby adversely affecting the company's operating performance.",

The proportion of sales revenue from the top five customers was 94.26%, 92.08%, 83.23%, and 73.31%, respectively. Among them, the proportion of sales revenue to the largest customer, NTN, was 59.18%, 52.62%, 44.52%, and 40.10%, respectively.\nThe downstream industry of the company mainly involves the manufacturing of constant velocity drive shafts, which has a high concentration of operators. NTN has long dominated the domestic constant velocity drive shaft market. According to its public data, NTN's market share is about 40%. Although the company continuously enhances its efforts to develop new customers, the development of new customers requires a certain cycle. If: (1) fluctuations in the automotive industry lead to a decline in the overall sales scale growth rate or even a decrease in sales in the domestic automotive market, causing a significant decline in NTN's business; (2) significant changes occur in the competitive landscape of the industry, leading to a decline in the competitiveness of the company's main customer, NTN, in the constant velocity drive shaft industry, resulting in significant adverse changes in its operating conditions, reduced market share, or even business stagnation; (3) the company's future product quality or comprehensive service capabilities fail to meet NTN's requirements, or the company's market development strategy does not align with market changes or customer needs. Any of the above situations may lead to the loss of procurement orders from the main customer, NTN, thereby causing significant adverse effects on the company's operating performance. In extreme cases, there may be a risk of a decline in operating profit by more than 50% or even a loss in the year of listing compared to the previous year. As of the date of signing this prospectus, the issuer has some houses and buildings without ownership certificates, with a total area of 1,755.26 square meters, mainly used for corridors, product testing areas, tooling molds, and scrap warehouses, accounting for 5.01% of the issuer's total self-owned housing area. These properties are not the main properties for the company's production and operation and have obtained the \"Construction Project Planning Permit.\" As of the date of signing this prospectus, the issuer has submitted relevant documents for the real estate ownership certificate to the Xiaoshan District Real Estate Registration Service Center in Hangzhou and received a receipt of acceptance. It is currently under review by the relevant departments. Although these houses and buildings are not the main production and operation sites of the issuer, if the company cannot obtain the corresponding ownership certificates, it may face risks such as being unable to continue using the relevant properties, being penalized, and being required to pay fines, which may adversely affect the issuer's production and operation. The company's main products are used in vehicle manufacturing, and its production and operation status is closely related to the development status and trends of the automotive industry. When the macroeconomy is in a boom phase, automobile production and consumption are active, the automotive industry develops rapidly, and the demand for constant velocity drive shaft-related products increases; conversely, when the macroeconomy enters a downturn phase, automobile consumption is sluggish, the automotive industry development slows down, and the demand for constant velocity drive shaft-related products decreases. The company's main customers are well-known domestic and foreign first-tier suppliers of automotive parts and vehicle manufacturers. If affected by the cyclical fluctuations of the automotive industry, customers may reduce their order demand from the company, thereby adversely affecting the company's operating performance.",

      "information": "The company's revenue growth is significantly influenced by the downstream automotive market. Due to the recovery of the automotive market, substantial increase in R&D investment by automotive manufacturers, continuous improvement in the penetration rate of new energy vehicles, and smooth expansion of the company's overseas markets, the company's revenue growth rates for 2021, 2022, and the first half of 2023 were 55.13%, 41.50%, and 16.27%, respectively, showing significant growth. In 2021 and 2022, the company's revenue growth rate was high due to the substantial increase in R&D investment by automotive manufacturers. However, it declined in the first half of 2023, and the revenue growth rate may further decline in the future. Additionally, during the reporting period, the company's revenue growth mainly came from new energy vehicle design and overseas automotive design business. If the automotive market declines or the penetration rate of new energy vehicles stagnates or the company's overseas market expansion is unfavorable, the company will face the risk of declining revenue growth.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the revenue from the company's fuel commercial vehicle design business accounted for 22.69%, 18.56%, 15.19%, and 14.44% of the automotive design business revenue, respectively. Affected by the \"National V to National VI emission standards\" and public health measures, commercial vehicle sales decreased by 6.6% and 31.2% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. In the first half of 2023, sales rebounded with a year-on-year growth of 15.8%, showing strong cyclicality. Although the company's commercial vehicle design revenue continued to grow due to continuous R&D investment by commercial vehicle customers during the reporting period and was not affected by the deterioration of downstream market sales, if the commercial vehicle market enters a downward cycle again in the future and customers reduce R&D investment, the company's revenue may not sustain high growth and may even face the risk of decline.\n\nDomestic independent automotive design companies have a short development history and are currently in the growth stage, with fierce market competition within the industry. Although the company has accumulated talent, technology, brand, and customer resources, and its comprehensive competitiveness remains at the forefront domestically, with the continuous improvement of design levels by other domestic automotive design companies, increased support for their R&D teams by automotive manufacturers, and the intensified business expansion of foreign independent automotive design companies in the Chinese market, automotive manufacturers may reduce the outsourcing ratio of automotive design R&D, intensifying competition in the domestic automotive design market and impacting the company's existing business.\n\nThe automotive industry, to which the company belongs, is a pillar industry of the national economy, and macroeconomic changes have a significant impact on the automotive industry. The growth rate of GDP has generally maintained a positive correlation with the automotive market. From 2020 to 2022, the GDP grew by 2.2%, 8.4%, and 3.0%, respectively. The GDP growth rate in 2023 is expected to be around 5%. If the GDP growth rate declines in the future, it may lead to a decline in the automotive market, affecting the company's revenue growth.\n\nChina's automotive market experienced three consecutive years of sales decline starting in 2018 and began to recover in 2021. Affected by this, the company's revenue maintained a growth trend in 2021, 2022, and the first half of 2023. If the automotive market re-enters a downward channel in the future, it may adversely affect the company's revenue.",

      "information": "At the end of each reporting period, the company's accounts receivable balances were 81.0177 million yuan, 64.5865 million yuan, 164.387 million yuan, and 112.9693 million yuan, accounting for 21.59%, 14.79%, 20.83%, and 20.04% of the revenue for each period, respectively. During the reporting period, although the company's main customers had good credit and a good historical repayment record, with accounts receivable turnover rates of 7.69 times/year, 6.00 times/year, 6.89 times/year, and 4.07 times/year, the accounts receivable balance at the end of the period is expected to gradually increase as the company's business scale expands. If customers operate poorly or there are disputes between the parties in the future, there may be a risk of accounts receivable not being recovered in a timely manner. At the end of each reporting period, the book values of the company's inventories were 67.2677 million yuan, 99.4557 million yuan, 98.3978 million yuan, and 48.4698 million yuan, accounting for 28.38%, 37.37%, 22.39%, and 14.45% of the total assets, respectively. The company continuously adjusts its procurement and production plans dynamically according to market demand changes, ensuring a reasonable inventory level. The inventory turnover rates during the reporting period were 5.07 times/year, 4.22 times/year, 6.13 times/year, and 5.39 times/year. However, if the company fails to accurately predict market demand in the future, or due to changes in market prices, the company fails to maintain continuous and effective management of inventory, it will face the risk of inventory devaluation. The main raw materials required for the company's production are chips, power supplies, PCB boards, electronic components, etc. The proportion of chip procurement in raw materials was 50.64%, 55.93%, 58.32%, and 55.86%, respectively, while the proportion of direct materials in the main business costs during each reporting period was about 90%. Therefore, changes in chip prices are one of the main factors affecting the company's production costs. Although the company's product quotations fully consider the impact of material costs, if chip prices continue to rise significantly in the future and the company's product prices cannot be adjusted in time, it will directly affect the company's production costs and gross profit margin, bringing an adverse impact on the company's profitability. The company's final chip suppliers are mainly Taiwanese companies Realtek and MediaTek. Future uncertainties in trade conditions may affect the company's chip supply situation, causing certain operational risks. Due to the fast update speed of products in the network terminal equipment industry, the company needs to continuously develop new technologies and new products. During the reporting period, the company attached great importance to market-oriented R&D innovation investment, with R&D investment amounts of 15.0588 million yuan, 18.023 million yuan, 27.4798 million yuan, and 12.0311 million yuan, accounting for 4.01%, 4.13%, 3.48%, and 4.27% of the revenue for each period, respectively. If the company's future product innovation direction is wrong or technological innovation fails, and the technology cannot form products or achieve industrialization, the R&D investment cannot be recovered, which will have an adverse impact on the company's operations.",

      "information": "As a globally renowned consumer electronics brand, Apple Inc. has a strict, complex, and long-term certification process for its supply chain suppliers to ensure product quality. This includes comprehensive assessments and evaluations of suppliers' technological research and development capabilities, product quality control, rapid response capabilities, and after-sales service capabilities. After entering Apple's supply chain, the issuer's main business focuses on providing Apple Inc. and its cooperating EMS manufacturers with intelligent testing equipment and precision assembly equipment for Apple's product precision components. During the reporting period, the issuer's sales revenue mainly came from Apple's cooperating EMS manufacturers. The company's main business, sales revenue, and customer structure are dependent on Apple's supply chain. If the issuer cannot maintain a close cooperative relationship with Apple Inc. and its cooperating EMS manufacturers in the future, and fails to develop customers in other fields and achieve diversified income sources, the company's future operating performance will face significant fluctuations. The company's intelligent testing equipment and precision assembly equipment are mainly used in Apple's notebook computer-related core components, represented by touch interaction modules. If market competition intensifies in the future, Apple's product design and functional features fail to gain recognition from end consumers, or Apple's marketing strategies, pricing strategies, and other business strategies make mistakes and cannot be adjusted for a long time, or if the downstream notebook computer industry experiences a large-scale contraction, it may affect the sales of Apple's products, which in turn will affect the related intelligent testing equipment and precision assembly equipment, thereby having a significant adverse impact on the company's operating performance. The issuer's core products, intelligent testing equipment and precision assembly equipment, have customized attributes, and continuous technological research and development is the key to timely and quickly responding to customers' customized needs. The downstream industry is characterized by high innovation, fast technological innovation, and short product replacement cycles, which puts higher demands on the company's technical reserves, rapid research and development, and differentiated production capabilities. If the company's product research and design capabilities cannot keep up with the pace of downstream industry and technological iteration, the company faces the risk of its technology and products being replaced by competitors, leading to customer loss, thereby adversely affecting the company's revenue scale and profitability. If the company's project research and development fails in the future, or the related technology fails to form products or achieve industrialization, it will have a significant adverse impact on the company's operating performance. If the company's product research and development level improves slowly, or if there is a major change in downstream touch interaction technology and the company cannot timely develop new technologies, new processes, and new products to match it, the core technology currently mastered by the company may be replaced by more advanced technology in the same industry, thereby having a significant adverse impact on the company's future business development.",

      "information": "The company, with optoelectronic signal transmission technology as its core, is mainly engaged in the research and development, production, and sales of signal transmission connection products, electroacoustic products, and 3C supporting products. In recent years, the consumer electronics industry has shown characteristics of short upgrade cycles and rapid changes in consumer preferences. If the company cannot quickly grasp market changes in the consumer electronics field and develop new products that meet customer needs, or if there are deviations in predicting market development trends, the company may face customer loss, which may lead to a decline in the company's revenue scale and competitiveness. As of the date of signing this prospectus, the company's production and operation site located at Jinghai West Road, Chang'an Town, Dongguan City, Guangdong Province, is leased, with a building area of 22,613 square meters and a lease term from May 1, 2023, to April 30, 2025. These leased factory buildings have not yet obtained property ownership certificates, and there are defects in the property rights. The issuer may be required to relocate in the future, so there is a risk of being unable to continue using the factory buildings. The company's products are mainly exported. During the reporting period, the company's main business income from overseas was 481.7575 million yuan, 607.1109 million yuan, 562.3666 million yuan, and 248.7121 million yuan, accounting for 71.31%, 72.80%, 65.16%, and 68.67% of the company's main business income, respectively, with the US market being one of the main sales markets for the company's products.\nDuring the reporting period, some of the company's products were on the list of additional tariffs in the United States. Due to the ever-changing international situation, if China and the United States fail to reach friendly consultations in the future, and trade frictions continue for a long time or even further escalate, and the company cannot take effective countermeasures, the price competitiveness of the company's products may be weakened, American consumers' demand for the company's products may decrease, and the company's operating performance may be adversely affected.",

The company focuses on antibody expression, antibody discovery, and optimization services, and has developed high-throughput antibody expression platforms, antibody discovery and optimization platforms, and stable cell line construction platforms. If the company cannot continuously strengthen its technological research and development and the construction of its technical talent team, and cannot maintain timely updates and investments in experimental equipment, it may lead to the company's inability to enhance its technical platforms, putting it at a disadvantage in future market competition, thereby affecting the company's future profitability and sustainable development capabilities. With the rapid development and increasing maturity of antibody drugs, industry competition continues to escalate. The competition among CRO service providers has upgraded from completing basic subcontracting tasks to empowering new drug research and development; in addition, internationalization and one-stop service capabilities have also set higher requirements for CRO service providers. The company mainly focuses on antibody expression and antibody discovery and optimization businesses, and has initially acquired the ability to provide one-stop services in the field of antibody discovery. However, due to the company's small size and specialized business, there is still a significant gap in providing one-stop services compared to leading CRO companies in the industry. If the company cannot continuously improve its technical level, research and development capabilities, and service quality, its competitive advantage and profitability will be adversely affected by intensified market competition. The company has established multiple core platform technologies around antibody discovery and optimization services and has mastered a series of proprietary technologies (Know-how). These technologies stem from years of internal research and development and service experience accumulation, ensuring the company's continuous innovation and profitability, and are an important manifestation of the company's market competitiveness. Since proprietary technologies are not suitable for patent protection and cannot be legally protected to maintain the company's technical secrets, there is a risk of core technology leakage. Even if the company seeks judicial protection, it will consume a large amount of human and material resources, which will adversely affect the company's production and operations. During the reporting period, the company's comprehensive gross profit margins were 76.66%, 73.72%, 65.88%, and 64.24%, respectively. Although the company's gross profit margin has declined, it remains at a high level. In the company's future development process, if there are significant adverse changes in domestic and foreign policy environments, intensified market competition, and rising labor and manufacturing costs, it will lead to a decrease in the company's bargaining power and an increase in production costs, which may further reduce the company's gross profit margin and affect the company's overall profitability.",

      "information": "In August 2021, the National Development and Reform Commission issued the \"Barometer of the Completion of Dual Control Targets for Energy Consumption in Various Regions in the First Half of 2021,\" listing multiple provinces (regions, cities) as warning areas for dual control of energy consumption; in September 2021, the National Development and Reform Commission released the \"Plan to Improve the Dual Control System for Energy Consumption Intensity and Total Volume,\" which put forward specific requirements for energy consumption intensity and total volume. Against this backdrop, many local governments have successively introduced policies on production and power restrictions.\n\nThe issuer's main production and operation location is in Guangdong Province, which is a first-level warning area for dual control of energy consumption. If future power and production restriction measures continue to tighten, the issuer's normal production and operation may be adversely affected, mainly including: on the sales side, it may lead to the company being unable to deliver products on time according to order requirements, downstream customers delaying or reducing orders due to their own power restrictions; on the production side, it may cause upstream suppliers to limit production, leading to the inability to supply main raw materials on time, rising raw material prices, and idling of the company's production facilities.\n\nDuring each reporting period, the proportion of the company's overseas sales revenue to main business income was 2.20%, 11.49%, 23.60%, and 42.36%, respectively. Although during the reporting period, there were no cases of major importing countries setting trade barriers or trade frictions, in recent years, influenced by geopolitical factors, trade protectionism has been on the rise. If such situations further deteriorate, it may adversely affect the company's production and operation.\n\nThe company's product research and development and production largely rely on professional talents, and maintaining the stability of core technical personnel with rich industry experience is an important guarantee for the company's survival and sustainable development. At the end of each reporting period, the number of the company's R&D personnel was 89, 129, 135, and 132, accounting for 11.70%, 13.95%, 16.05%, and 16.10% of the total number of employees, respectively. With the development of China's dyeing and finishing equipment industry, competition for industry talents is becoming increasingly fierce. If the company fails to continuously provide competitive treatment and working environment, it may face the risk of losing technical personnel in the future, thereby affecting the company's technological innovation capability and causing adverse effects on the company's operating performance and long-term development.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the company's operating income was 573.0926 million yuan, 720.5799 million yuan, 686.3202 million yuan, and 361.8778 million yuan, respectively, and the net profit attributable to shareholders of the parent company was 117.2714 million yuan, 163.8554 million yuan, 96.1334 million yuan, and 55.6972 million yuan, respectively. In 2022, the company's operating performance experienced a significant decline, with operating income down 4.75% year-on-year and net profit attributable to shareholders of the parent company down 41.33% year-on-year, mainly due to the impact of changes in the macroeconomic environment leading to a decline in the prosperity of the downstream textile industry, the continuous high operation of steel and other raw material prices, and the continuous increase in the company's R&D investment.\n\nIn the future, the development trend of the macroeconomic environment and the price changes of production factors are highly uncertain. If the relevant adverse factors cannot be eliminated, and the company fails to take timely and effective countermeasures, it will adversely affect the company's profitability, leading to the risk of fluctuations and declines in the company's operating performance.",

      "information": "The company is a pharmaceutical enterprise specializing in the development of drugs for central nervous system diseases. Based on the evolution of industry technology and market development trends, the company continuously develops new technologies and new products. As of the date of signing this prospectus, the company has a total of 18 major research projects focusing on central nervous system diseases, covering 7 improved new drugs and 11 high-end generic drugs. Due to the possibility of changes in drug market demand over time, it cannot be ruled out that the company's research products may face the possibility of commercial value being lower than expected after approval and listing. At the same time, since the progress and success rate of drug research and development are affected by many factors such as preclinical research, clinical research, and drug market review and approval, the progress of the company's research products in the future may also be surpassed by competitors or may fail to be approved due to research and development failures.\nIn summary, if the company terminates research projects or the commercial value after listing is lower than expected due to delays in research project progress or failure to obtain approval, it will adversely affect the company's operating performance, profitability, and growth. According to the \"Guiding Opinions of the National Medical Security Administration on Establishing a Credit Evaluation System for Drug Prices and Procurement\" (Medical Insurance Issuance [2020] No. 34) issued by the National Medical Security Administration in August 2020, the National Medical Security Administration has established a list of dishonest items for drug prices and procurement, which is dynamically adjusted. The dishonest items included in the list mainly include giving kickbacks or other improper benefits in drug purchases and sales, tax-related violations, monopolistic behavior, improper pricing behavior, disrupting centralized procurement order, maliciously violating contract agreements, and other behaviors contrary to honesty and credit. At the same time, provincial centralized procurement agencies implement credit ratings based on reliable sources, clear conditions, standardized procedures, and strict operations. According to the nature, circumstances, timeliness, and impact of dishonest behavior, the dishonest situation of pharmaceutical companies in the local bidding procurement market is rated as general, medium, serious, and particularly serious, and dynamically updated every quarter. Provincial centralized procurement agencies take disposal measures based on the credit rating of pharmaceutical companies, such as written reminders and warnings, relying on the centralized procurement platform to inform purchasers of risk information, restricting or suspending the listing of related drugs or medical consumables, restricting or suspending the procurement of related drugs or medical consumables, and disclosing dishonest information. If the number of provinces involved in dishonest behavior reaches the specified conditions, the National Medical Security Administration's Drug Price and Bidding Procurement Guidance Center will initiate nationwide joint disposal. If the supply structure of the involved drugs or medical consumables is single and the supply-demand situation is tense, graded disposal measures will be taken on the basis of ensuring supply.\nIf the company engages in pharmaceutical commercial bribery, tax-related violations, monopolistic behavior, improper pricing behavior, disrupting centralized procurement order, maliciously violating contract agreements, and other behaviors contrary to honesty and credit in the future, the company will face the risk of being included in the list of dishonest items for drug prices and procurement, which will adversely affect the company's operations.",

The customers of solar cells are mainly downstream module manufacturers. Due to the characteristics of the industry, the company's solar cell business has a high customer concentration. During the reporting period, the sales revenue of the company's top five solar cell customers accounted for 36.90%, 68.39%, 66.62%, and 64.62% of the operating income, respectively. Although the main customers of the company's solar cell business are well-known module manufacturers with good reputations, and under normal circumstances, the company will maintain a long-term stable cooperative relationship with them after becoming a qualified supplier of the above-mentioned well-known module manufacturers through strict certification, if the main customers of the company experience adverse changes in their business or financial conditions, or if the stable cooperative relationship between the company and the main customers undergoes adverse changes, it may have an adverse impact on the company's operating performance.\nDuring the reporting period, the company needed to procure raw materials such as silicon wafers and slurry for solar cells. Due to the characteristics of the industry, the company's supplier concentration is high. During the reporting period, the procurement proportion of the company's top five suppliers for the solar cell business was 57.35%, 75.15%, 73.72%, and 74.69%, respectively. The company's procurement proportion from major suppliers is relatively high. If the main suppliers have insufficient supply or quality issues with the supplied materials, China is a major producer of photovoltaic products, with a high proportion of photovoltaic product output globally. In 2022, China's production proportions of polysilicon, silicon wafers, cells, and modules accounted for 85.6%, 97.4%, 90.3%, and 84.8% of the global total, respectively. In recent years, with the emphasis on energy security by various countries and the emphasis on localization of production and supply chains, the photovoltaic industry has gradually become the focus of various countries in building energy supply security and supply chain internal circulation systems. On the one hand, major countries and regions have comprehensively implemented policies to strongly promote the localization of photovoltaic manufacturing. On the other hand, some photovoltaic product importing countries have successively started anti-dumping and countervailing investigations on Chinese photovoltaic products, planning or implementing policies to impose high anti-dumping and countervailing duties, and conducting investigations on behaviors that evade \"double anti\" policies. In the future, if trade frictions occur between China and major photovoltaic product importing countries, it will affect the overseas sales of Chinese photovoltaic products, especially photovoltaic modules, which will in turn affect the market demand for upstream cells, thereby adversely affecting the company's future operating performance.",

      "information": "During the reporting period, the amounts of raw materials purchased by the company from the top five suppliers were 295.2618 million yuan, 638.4053 million yuan, 1,883.4369 million yuan, and 1,230.2506 million yuan, accounting for 65.53%, 83.25%, 78.87%, and 84.47% of the total raw material purchases for the period, respectively. The company's POE resin is mainly supplied by overseas chemical companies such as Mitsui Chemicals, LG Chem, and Dow Chemical, while EVA resin is mainly supplied by domestic and overseas chemical companies such as Lianhong New Science & Technology, Zhejiang Petrochemical, and Hanwha Total. To ensure the supply of raw materials and reduce the impact of raw material price fluctuations on operations, the company has maintained long-term stable cooperation with major raw material suppliers. If there are significant adverse changes in the production and operation of major raw material suppliers or their cooperation with the company, the company will face risks such as fluctuations in raw material purchase prices, insufficient or untimely supply, which will adversely affect the company's production and operations. At the end of each reporting period, the book values of the company's inventory were 43.9301 million yuan, 114.4826 million yuan, 664.2442 million yuan, and 852.7967 million yuan, mainly consisting of raw materials and goods in transit. During the reporting period, the company's product sales prices and raw material prices fluctuated significantly, resulting in the risk of inventory write-down losses. The amounts of inventory write-downs at the end of each reporting period were 337,200 yuan, 3.0833 million yuan, 25.2328 million yuan, and 13.2933 million yuan. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the price of EVA raw materials dropped significantly, and the company's EVA film sales prices quickly fell in line with the current raw material purchase prices. The cost of inventory lagged behind, resulting in the net realizable value of inventory being lower than the carrying cost. At the end of 2022, the company's inventory write-downs amounted to 25.2328 million yuan. If the prices of the company's main raw materials fluctuate significantly in the future, the company will face the risk of inventory impairment, which will adversely affect the company's operating performance. The company's film products are mainly used in the photovoltaic industry, which, as a green and clean energy source, has good development prospects. As a strategic emerging industry, the photovoltaic industry is influenced by factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industrial policies, the balanced development of various links in the industrial chain, market demand, and the comparative advantages of other energy sources, and its development has certain volatility characteristics. If the development of the photovoltaic industry fluctuates in the future, leading to a decline in the demand for photovoltaic films, it will adversely affect the company's operations.\nIn recent years, the photovoltaic film market in China has developed rapidly, with major participating companies actively developing new products and expanding production capacity to maintain or gain larger market shares, further intensifying market competition. With technological development and performance improvement, downstream photovoltaic module manufacturers will increasingly emphasize the protective and encapsulating functions of films, and market competition will fully unfold around product quality, technological research and development, market marketing, and financial strength. If the company cannot take effective measures to actively respond to the increasingly fierce market competition, it will adversely affect its operating performance.",

      "information": "The company is a high-tech enterprise mainly engaged in the research and development, production, and sales of explosion-proof industrial dust removal equipment. With the acceleration of production process changes, downstream industries such as lithium batteries and photovoltaics have put forward higher requirements for dust treatment processes, dust removal efficiency, and explosion-proof performance, promoting industrial dust removal equipment companies to further innovate their product processes and technologies. On the one hand, the company needs to grasp the development trend of dust explosion-proof technology; on the other hand, it must continuously meet the changing performance requirements of dust removal equipment due to the production process innovations in downstream industries. Therefore, the company needs to carry out continuous technological innovation and iterative product development. If the company cannot accurately grasp the trends in technology, products, and the market in the future, or if there is a significant deviation in understanding these trends, it will affect the company's sustained competitiveness.\n\nIn recent years, the company's production and operation scale has rapidly expanded, the asset scale has correspondingly increased, and the personnel has also been rapidly expanding, putting higher demands on the operational capabilities, market expansion, resource integration, and internal control of the company's management team. However, with the continued development of the company's business, especially after this issuance and listing and the commissioning of the fundraising investment projects, the company's production and operation scale will further expand. If the company's relevant management measures cannot adapt to the rapid expansion of the company's scale, and the talent reserve and management level cannot adapt to the development changes of the company's internal and external environment, the company may face management risks caused by the rapid expansion of the operating scale.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the company's operating income mainly came from the lithium battery industry. In recent years, downstream lithium battery manufacturers have significantly expanded production, continuously increasing battery capacity, driving the rapid growth of demand in the upstream battery equipment market. Therefore, the company's income from the lithium battery industry also increased significantly in 2022. If the growth rate of the lithium battery industry slows down or declines in the future, the market demand for the company's products in the lithium battery field will be affected. If the company's other business areas do not achieve good results at the same time, it will adversely affect the company's performance.",

      "information": "The company's products are mainly aimed at strategic emerging industries such as new energy vehicles, charging piles, photovoltaic energy storage, and data communication. These industries are characterized by relatively fast technological upgrades and product iterations. As the new energy industry continues to develop, the requirements for power conversion, control, and usage efficiency are constantly increasing, and power electronic components are continuously developing towards high power density and high conversion efficiency.\n\nWith the continuous development of downstream industries, rapid technological upgrades in the industry, and intensified market competition, customers have increasingly higher requirements for the R&D innovation capabilities of magnetic components and charging module manufacturing enterprises in product development, design, material selection, and manufacturing processes. If the company cannot continuously maintain the innovation of technology and products or misjudges the industry technology trends and market product demands, it may lead to the company's new technologies and new products not being recognized by customers, failing to meet the rapid development needs of downstream industries, losing advantages in the increasingly fierce industry competition, and thus adversely affecting the company's development. As of the signing date of this prospectus, the company's production and operation sites and the locations proposed for the expansion and fundraising projects are all obtained through leasing, and some of them have not yet obtained property certificates from the lessor. If in the future, due to the above-mentioned leasing defects, the properties cannot be used normally, the factory lease expires and cannot be renewed, suitable replacement factories cannot be quickly found after the expiration, or other situations affecting the normal use of leased factories occur, it may adversely affect the stability of the company's production and operation and the implementation of fundraising projects.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the book value of the company's inventory was 79.7204 million yuan, 128.2454 million yuan, 175.4538 million yuan, and 168.5188 million yuan, accounting for 32.80%, 36.58%, 36.16%, and 33.90% of current assets, respectively, which is relatively high. With the further growth of sales revenue and asset scale, the company's inventory will also increase accordingly. If adverse changes occur in the future market operating environment, raw material prices, product market demand, etc., leading to price drops, backlog, and unsalable inventory, the company will face the risk of inventory impairment and provision for price drops, which will adversely affect the financial status.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the proportion of direct material costs to the main business costs of the company was 59.16%, 59.67%, 62.71%, and 63.97%, respectively, and the prices of raw materials have a significant impact on the main business costs. The main raw materials for the company's magnetic component products include wires, magnetic materials, and insulating materials, while the main raw materials for charging module products include semiconductors, capacitors, and PCB boards. Among them, the purchase amount of wires and magnetic materials accounts for a relatively high proportion of the company's total raw material purchases, with a combined proportion of 64.01%, 65.81%, 63.61%, and 58.99% in each period, respectively.\n\nWires and magnetic materials are greatly affected by bulk material price fluctuations. Assuming other factors remain unchanged, if the purchase prices of wires and magnetic materials change by 5% in 2022, according to the company's hypothetical calculations, the impact on the company's total profit would be 6.71% and 5.37%, respectively. If the prices of major raw materials fluctuate sharply in the short term in the future, and the company cannot effectively pass on the pressure of rising raw material prices or cannot offset the pressure of rising raw material costs through technological process innovation, or fails to manage inventory well when prices fall, it will squeeze the product profit margin and may adversely affect the company's operating performance.",
